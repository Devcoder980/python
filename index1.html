 <br> In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the
<br> keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to
<br> Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth
<br> pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce
<br> and communities have to help one another.
<br> For many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive.
<br> According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to
<br> longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming
<br> strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family
<br> relations.
<br> Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce
<br> stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.
<br> 1
<br> They don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks
<br> and working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather
<br> walk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a
<br> practice almost all of them have in common.
<br> The 80 percent secret
<br> One of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated
<br> before or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.”
<br> Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans
<br> stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity,
<br> rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive
<br> processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.
<br> Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80
<br> percent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating
<br> when we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we
<br> know in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will
<br> give us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in
<br> the long term.
<br> The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many
<br> small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan
<br> is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish
<br> slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are
<br> going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling
<br> slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose
<br> weight and stay trim.
<br> Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average
<br> of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and
<br> have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United
<br> States.
<br> The Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week),
<br> and vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition
<br> we will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent.
<br> Moai: Connected for life
<br> It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai
<br> is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one
<br> another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.
<br> The moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to
<br> share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.
<br> Members of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This
<br> payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi
<br> (Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.
<br> The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money
<br> left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from
<br> the surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and
<br> financial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get
<br> an advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each moai’s accounting
<br> practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of
<br> belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase
<br> life expectancy.

<br> FOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at
<br> a few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different
<br> factors related to ikigai.
<br> II
<br> ANTIAGING SECRETS
<br> Little things that add up to a long
<br> and happy life
<br> Aging’s escape velocity
<br> For more than a century, we’ve managed to add an average of 0.3 years to our life
<br> expectancy every year. But what would happen if we had the technology to add a
<br> year of life expectancy every year? In theory, we would achieve biological
<br> immortality, having reached aging’s “escape velocity.”
<br> Aging’s Escape Velocity and the Rabbit
<br> Imagine a sign far off in the future with a number on it that
<br> represents the age of your death. Every year that you live,
<br> you advance closer to the sign. When you reach the sign, you die.
<br> Now imagine a rabbit holding the sign and walking to the future. Every
<br> year that you live, the rabbit is half a year as far away. After a while, you
<br> will reach the rabbit and die.
<br> But what if the rabbit could walk at a pace of one year for every year
<br> of your life? You would never be able to catch the rabbit, and therefore
<br> you would never die.
<br> The speed at which the rabbit walks to the future is our technology.
<br> The more we advance technology and knowledge of our bodies, the faster
<br> we can make the rabbit walk.
<br> Aging’s escape velocity is the moment at which the rabbit walks at a
<br> pace of one year per year or faster, and we become immortal.
<br> Researchers with an eye to the future, such as Ray Kurzweil and Aubrey de
<br> Grey, claim that we’ll reach this escape velocity in a matter of decades. Other
<br> scientists are less optimistic, predicting that we’ll reach a limit, a maximum age
<br> we won’t be able to surpass, no matter how much technology we have. For
<br> example, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120
<br> years.
<br> Active mind, youthful body
<br> There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a
<br> There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a
<br> sound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are
<br> important, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been
<br> shown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in
<br> staying young.
<br> Having a youthful mind also drives you toward a healthy lifestyle that will
<br> slow the aging process.
<br> Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and
<br> mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and
<br> neural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to
<br> our surroundings.
<br> This is why it’s so important to give your brain a workout.
<br> One pioneer in advocating for mental exercise is the Israeli neuroscientist
<br> Shlomo Breznitz, who argues that the brain needs a lot of stimulation in order to
<br> stay in shape. As he stated in an interview with Eduard Punset for the Spanish
<br> television program Redes:
<br> There is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do. This is because people,
<br> especially older people, like to do things as they’ve always done them. The problem is that when the
<br> brain develops ingrained habits, it doesn’t need to think anymore. Things get done quickly and
<br> efficiently on automatic pilot, often in a very advantageous way. This creates a tendency to stick to
<br> routines, and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain with new information.
<br> 1
<br> Presented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is
<br> revitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if
<br> stepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety.
<br> The effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated.
<br> According to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book Maximum
<br> Brainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom, mental training is
<br> beneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain
<br> task for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you
<br> learn how to do it, the training is already working. The second time, you realize
<br> that it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a
<br> fantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that
<br> affects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.”
<br> This description of a “mental workout” might sound a bit formal, but simply
<br> interacting with others—playing a game, for example—offers new stimuli and
<br> helps prevent the depression that can come with solitude.
<br> Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is
<br> Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is
<br> slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing
<br> with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and
<br> interacting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the
<br> mind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater
<br> mental benefits.
<br> Stress: Accused of killing longevity
<br> Many people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature
<br> aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down
<br> much faster during periods of crisis. The American Institute of Stress
<br> investigated this degenerative process and concluded that most health problems
<br> are caused by stress.
<br> Researchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which
<br> they subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more
<br> stressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes.
<br> Afterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his
<br> antibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating
<br> the proteins that trigger an immune response. The problem is that this response
<br> not only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to
<br> age prematurely.
<br> The University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and
<br> samples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness
<br> of one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with
<br> healthy children and low levels of stress. They found that stress promotes cellular
<br> aging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular
<br> regeneration and how our cells age. As the study revealed, the greater the stress,
<br> the greater the degenerative effect on cells.
<br> How does stress work?
<br> These days, people live at a frantic pace and in a nearly constant state of
<br> competition. At this fever pitch, stress is a natural response to the information
<br> being received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic.
<br> Theoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile
<br> surroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to
<br> surroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to
<br> deal with difficult situations and to flee from predators.
<br> The alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary
<br> gland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin, which in turn
<br> circulates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal
<br> gland is then triggered to release adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline raises our
<br> respiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body
<br> ready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of
<br> dopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to
<br> face challenges.
<br> Cave Dwellers Modern Humans
<br> Were relaxed most of the time. Work most of the time and are alert to any and all threats.
<br> Felt stress only in very specific
<br> situations.
<br> Are online or waiting for notifications from their cell phones twenty-four hours a
<br> day.
<br> The threats were real: A predator could
<br> end their lives at any moment.
<br> The brain associates the ping of a cell phone or an e-mail notification with the
<br> threat of a predator.
<br> High doses of cortisol and adrenaline at
<br> moments of danger kept the body
<br> healthy.
<br> Low doses of cortisol flow constantly through the body, with implications for a
<br> range of health problems, including adrenal fatigue and chronic fatigue
<br> syndrome.
<br> These processes are, in moderation, beneficial—they help us overcome
<br> challenges in our daily lives. Nonetheless, the stress to which human beings are
<br> subjected today is clearly harmful.
<br> Stress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency
<br> affects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of
<br> certain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary
<br> effects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure.
<br> As such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we
<br> should adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of
<br> our bodies.
<br> Be mindful about reducing stress
<br> Whether or not the threats we perceive are real, stress is an easily identifiable
<br> condition that not only causes anxiety but is also highly psychosomatic, affecting
<br> everything from our digestive system to our skin.
<br> This is why prevention is so important in avoiding the toll that stress takes on
<br> us—and why many experts recommend practicing mindfulness.
<br> The central premise of this stress-reduction method is focusing on the self:
<br> noticing our responses, even if they are conditioned by habit, in order to be fully
<br> conscious of them. In this way, we connect with the here and now and limit
<br> thoughts that tend to spiral out of control.
<br> “We have to learn to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop.
<br> We all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news.
<br> You ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,”
<br> says Roberto Alcibar, who abandoned his fast-paced life to become a certified
<br> instructor of mindfulness after an illness threw him into a period of acute stress.
<br> One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps
<br> filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be
<br> achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.
<br> Achieving mindfulness involves a gradual process of training, but with a bit of
<br> practice we can learn to focus our mind completely, which reduces stress and
<br> helps us live longer.
<br> A little stress is good for you
<br> While sustained, intense stress is a known enemy of longevity and both mental
<br> and physical health, low levels of stress have been shown to be beneficial.
<br> After observing a group of test subjects for more than twenty years, Dr.
<br> Howard S. Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California,
<br> Riverside, discovered that people who maintained a low level of stress, who faced
<br> challenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order to succeed, lived
<br> longer than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier. From
<br> this, he concluded that a small dose of stress is a positive thing, as those who live
<br> with low levels of stress tend to develop healthier habits, smoke less, and drink
<br> less alcohol.
<br> 2
<!--
<br> Given this, it is not surprising that many of the supercentenarians—people
<br> who live to be 110 or more—whom we’ll meet in this book talk about having
<br> lived intense lives and working well into old age.
<br> A lot of sitting will age you
<br> In the Western world in particular, the rise in sedentary behavior has led to
<br> numerous diseases such as hypertension and obesity, which in turn affect
<br> longevity.
<br> Spending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular
<br> and respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to
<br> participate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced
<br> eating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer.
<br> Recent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and
<br> the progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those
<br> cells and, in turn, the organism as a whole.
<br> This is a problem at all life stages, not only among adults. Sedentary children
<br> suffer from high rates of obesity and all its associated health issues and risks,
<br> which is why it’s so important to develop a healthy and active lifestyle at an early
<br> age.
<br> It’s easy to be less sedentary; it just takes a bit of effort and a few changes to
<br> your routine. We can access a more active lifestyle that makes us feel better
<br> inside and out—we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits:
<br> Walk to work, or just go on a walk for at least twenty minutes each day.
<br> Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator. This is good for your
<br> posture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things.
<br> Participate in social or leisure activities so that you don’t spend too much time
<br> in front of the television.
<br> Replace your junk food with fruit and you’ll have less of an urge to snack,
<br> and more nutrients in your system.
<br> Get the right amount of sleep. Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than
<br> that makes us lethargic.
<br> Play with children or pets, or join a sports team. This not only strengthens the
<br> body but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem.
<br> Be conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and
<br> replace them with more positive ones.
<br> By making these small changes, we can begin to renew our bodies and minds
<br> and increase our life expectancy.
<br> A model’s best-kept secret
<br> A model’s best-kept secret
<br> Though we age both externally and internally, both physically and mentally, one
<br> of the things that tell us the most about people’s age is their skin, which takes on
<br> different textures and colors according to processes going on beneath the surface.
<br> Most of those who make their living as models claim to sleep between nine and
<br> ten hours the night before a fashion show. This gives their skin a taut, wrinklefree appearance and a healthy, radiant glow.
<br> Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep
<br> we generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal
<br> gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal
<br> and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles.
<br> A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the
<br> following benefits:
<br> It strengthens the immune system.
<br> It contains an element that protects against cancer.
<br> It promotes the natural production of insulin.
<br> It slows the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
<br> It helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease.
<br> For all these reasons, melatonin is a great ally in preserving youth. It should be
<br> noted, however, that melatonin production decreases after age thirty. We can
<br> compensate for this by:
<br> Eating a balanced diet and getting more calcium.
<br> Soaking up a moderate amount of sun each day.
<br> Getting enough sleep.
<br> Avoiding stress, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, all of which make it harder
<br> to get a good night’s rest, depriving us of the melatonin we need.
<br> Experts are trying to determine whether artificially stimulating production of
<br> melatonin might help slow the aging process . . . which would confirm the theory
<br> that we already carry the secret to longevity within us.
<br> Antiaging attitudes
<br> The mind has tremendous power over the body and how quickly it ages. Most
<br> doctors agree that the secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active
<br> —a key element of ikigai—and in not caving in when we face difficulties
<br> throughout our lives.
<br> One study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live
<br> the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high
<br> degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a
<br> positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their
<br> way toward longevity.
<br> A stoic attitude—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you
<br> young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be
<br> seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate
<br> lifestyles.
<br> Many centenarians and supercentenarians have similar profiles: They have had
<br> full lives that were difficult at times, but they knew how to approach these
<br> challenges with a positive attitude and not be overwhelmed by the obstacles they
<br> faced.
<br> Alexander Imich, who in 2014 became the world’s oldest living man at age
<br> 111, knew he had good genes but understood that other factors contributed, too:
<br> “The life you live is equally or more important for longevity,” he said in an
<br> interview with Reuters after being added to Guinness World Records in 2014.
<br> An ode to longevity
<br> During our stay in Ogimi, the village that holds the Guinness record for longevity,
<br> a woman who was about to turn 100 years old sang the following song for us in a
<br> mixture of Japanese and the local dialect:
<br> To keep healthy and have a long life,
<br> eat just a little of everything with relish,
<br> go to bed early, get up early, and then go out for a walk.
<br> We live each day with serenity and we enjoy the journey.
<br> To keep healthy and have a long life,
<br> we get on well with all of our friends.
<br> Spring, summer, fall, winter,
<br> we happily enjoy all the seasons.

<br> look at the close relationship between longevity and discovering our life’s
<br> mission.
<br> III
<br> FROM LOGOTHERAPY TO IKIGAI
<br> How to live longer and better by
<br> finding your purpose
<br> What is logotherapy?
<br> A colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a
<br> single phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up
<br> straight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The
<br> colleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In
<br> psychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on
<br> occasion, hard to say.”
<br> Frankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was
<br> “Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to,
<br> and was able to carry on. What, then, does logotherapy do?
<br> 1
<br> The answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live.
<br> Logotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life’s purpose in
<br> order to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates
<br> them to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming
<br> whatever obstacles they encounter along the way.
<br> Something to Live For
<br> A study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both
<br> patients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings
<br> needed a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone
<br> or something in their lives worth dying for.
<br> 2
<br> The search for meaning
<br> The search for purpose became a personal, driving force that allowed Frankl to
<br> achieve his goals. The process of logotherapy can be summarized in these five
<br> steps:
<br> 1. A person feels empty, frustrated, or anxious.
<br> 2. The therapist shows him that what he is feeling is the desire to have a
<br> meaningful life.
<br> 3. The patient discovers his life’s purpose (at that particular point in time).
<br> 4. Of his own free will, the patient decides to accept or reject that destiny.
<br> 5. This newfound passion for life helps him overcome obstacles and sorrows.
<br> Frankl himself would live and die for his principles and ideals. His
<br> experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz showed him that “Everything can be taken
<br> from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s
<br> attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”
<br> 3
<br> It was
<br> something he had to go through alone, without any help, and it inspired him for
<br> the rest of his life.
<br> Ten Differences Between Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy
<br> Psychoanalysis Logotherapy
<br> The patient reclines on a couch, like a patient.
<br> The patient sits facing the therapist, who guides him or her without
<br> passing judgment.
<br> Is retrospective: It looks to the past. Looks toward the future.
<br> Is introspective: It analyzes neuroses. Does not delve into the patient’s neuroses.
<br> The drive is toward pleasure. The drive is toward purpose and meaning.
<br> Centers on psychology. Includes a spiritual dimension.
<br> Works on psychogenic neuroses. Also works on noogenic, or existential, neuroses.
<br> Analyzes the unconscious origin of conflicts
<br> (instinctual dimension).
<br> Deals with conflicts when and where they arise (spiritual
<br> dimension).
<br> Limits itself to the patient’s instincts. Also deals with spiritual realities.
<br> Is fundamentally incompatible with faith. Is compatible with faith.
<br> Seeks to reconcile conflicts and satisfy impulses and
<br> instincts.
<br> Seeks to help the patient find meaning in his life and satisfy his
<br> moral principles.
<br> Fight for yourself
<br> Existential frustration arises when our life is without purpose, or when that
<br> purpose is skewed. In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this
<br> frustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive
<br> thing—a catalyst for change.
<br> thing—a catalyst for change.
<br> Logotherapy does not see this frustration as mental illness, the way other forms
<br> of therapy do, but rather as spiritual anguish—a natural and beneficial
<br> phenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their
<br> own or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life.
<br> It helps them change their own destiny.
<br> Logotherapy enters the picture if the person needs help doing this, if he needs
<br> guidance in discovering his life’s purpose and later in overcoming conflicts so he
<br> can keep moving toward his objective. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl cites
<br> one of Nietzsche’s famous aphorisms: “He who has a why to live for can bear
<br> with almost any how.”
<br> Based on his own experience, Frankl believed that our health depends on that
<br> natural tension that comes from comparing what we’ve accomplished so far with
<br> what we’d like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful
<br> existence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our
<br> disposal.
<br> Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which
<br> people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want
<br> to do. They often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what
<br> they want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by
<br> numbing their senses. It can even lead to suicide.
<br> Sunday neurosis, for example, is what happens when, without the obligations
<br> and commitments of the workweek, the individual realizes how empty he is
<br> inside. He has to find a solution. Above all, he has to find his purpose, his reason
<br> for getting out of bed—his ikigai.
<br> “I Feel Empty Inside”
<br> In a study conducted at the Vienna Polyclinic Hospital, Frankl’s team
<br> found that 55 percent of the patients they interviewed were experiencing
<br> some degree of existential crisis.
<br> 4
<br> According to logotherapy, discovering one’s purpose in life helps an individual
<br> fill that existential void. Frankl, a man who faced his problems and turned his
<br> objectives into actions, could look back on his life in peace as he grew old. He
<br> did not have to envy those still enjoying their youth, because he had amassed a
<br> broad set of experiences that showed he had lived for something.
<br> Better living through logotherapy: A few key ideas
<br> We don’t create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed—we discover it.
<br> We each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or
<br> transformed many times over the years.
<br> Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared,
<br> excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire
<br> from being fulfilled.
<br> Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety.
<br> We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the
<br> equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in
<br> which we find ourselves.
<br> In the pages that follow, we will look at four cases from Frankl’s own practice
<br> in order to better understand the search for meaning and purpose.
<br> Case study: Viktor Frankl
<br> In German concentration camps, as in those that would later be built in Japan and
<br> Korea, psychiatrists confirmed that the prisoners with the greatest chance of
<br> survival were those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp,
<br> those who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. This was true of Frankl,
<br> who, after being released and successfully developing the school of logotherapy,
<br> realized he had been the first patient of his own practice.
<br> Frankl had a goal to achieve, and it made him persevere. He arrived at
<br> Auschwitz carrying a manuscript that contained all the theories and research he
<br> had compiled over the course of his career, ready for publication. When it was
<br> confiscated, he felt compelled to write it all over again, and that need drove him
<br> and gave his life meaning amid the constant horror and doubt of the
<br> concentration camp—so much so that over the years, and especially when he fell
<br> ill with typhus, he would jot down fragments and key words from the lost work
<br> on any scrap of paper he found.
<br> Case study: The American diplomat
<br> An important North American diplomat went to Frankl to pick up where he left
<br> off with a course of treatment he had started five years earlier in the United
<br> States. When Frankl asked him why he’d started therapy in the first place, the
<br> diplomat answered that he hated his job and his country’s international policies,
<br> which he had to follow and enforce. His American psychoanalyst, whom he’d
<br> been seeing for years, insisted he make peace with his father so that his
<br> government and his job, both representations of the paternal figure, would seem
<br> less disagreeable. Frankl, however, showed him in just a few sessions that his
<br> frustration was due to the fact that he wanted to pursue a different career, and the
<br> diplomat concluded his treatment with that idea in mind.
<br> Five years later, the former diplomat informed Frankl that he had been
<br> working during that time in a different profession, and that he was happy.
<br> In Frankl’s view, the man not only didn’t need all those years of
<br> psychoanalysis, he also couldn’t even really be considered a “patient” in need of
<br> therapy. He was simply someone in search of a new life’s purpose; as soon as he
<br> found it, his life took on deeper meaning.
<br> Case study: The suicidal mother
<br> The mother of a boy who had died at age eleven was admitted to Frankl’s clinic
<br> after she tried to kill herself and her other son. It was this other son, paralyzed
<br> since birth, who kept her from carrying out her plan: He did believe his life had a
<br> purpose, and if his mother killed them both, it would keep him from achieving
<br> his goals.
<br> The woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked
<br> another woman to imagine a hypothetical situation in which she lay on her
<br> deathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she
<br> would have felt her life had been a failure.
<br> When the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining
<br> herself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done
<br> everything in her power for her children—for both of them. She had given her
<br> paralyzed son a good life, and he had turned into a kind, reasonably happy person.
<br> To this she added, crying, “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life;
<br> for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to live it fully; I
<br> have done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”
<br> have done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”
<br> In this way, by imagining herself on her deathbed and looking back, the
<br> suicidal mother found the meaning that, though she was not aware of it, her life
<br> already had.
<br> Case study: The grief-stricken doctor
<br> An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen
<br> after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help.
<br> Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him
<br> what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor,
<br> horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she
<br> would have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see,
<br> doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for
<br> this is to survive, and mourn her.”
<br> The doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after
<br> taking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of
<br> his beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose.
<br> Morita therapy
<br> In the same decade that logotherapy came into being—a few years earlier, in fact
<br> —Shoma Morita created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It proved to
<br> be effective in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
<br> posttraumatic stress.
<br> In addition to being a psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and
<br> his therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan.
<br> Many Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the
<br> patient’s emotions. In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences
<br> how we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy
<br> focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them,
<br> since their feelings will change as a result of their actions.
<br> In addition to accepting the patient’s emotions, Morita therapy seeks to
<br> “create” new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these
<br> emotions are learned through experience and repetition.
<br> Morita therapy is not meant to eliminate symptoms; instead it teaches us to
<br> accept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As Morita
<br> writes in his book Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based
<br> Disorders, “In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.”
<br> Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following
<br> fable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post
<br> in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the
<br> post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more
<br> trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and
<br> discomfort.
<br> 5
<br> The basic principles of Morita therapy
<br> 1. Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to
<br> control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense. Regarding
<br> human emotions, the Zen master would say, “If we try to get rid of one wave with
<br> another, we end up with an infinite sea.” We don’t create our feelings; they
<br> simply come to us, and we have to accept them. The trick is welcoming them.
<br> Morita likened emotions to the weather: We can’t predict or control them; we can
<br> only observe them. To this point, he often quoted the Vietnamese monk Thich
<br> Nhat Hanh, who would say, “Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with
<br> me, and I will care for you.”
<br> 6
<br> 2. Do what you should be doing. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms,
<br> because recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present
<br> moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we
<br> should avoid intellectualizing the situation. The therapist’s mission is to develop
<br> the patient’s character so he or she can face any situation, and character is
<br> grounded in the things we do. Morita therapy does not offer its patients
<br> explanations, but rather allows them to learn from their actions and activities. It
<br> doesn’t tell you how to meditate, or how to keep a diary the way Western
<br> therapies do. It is up to the patient to make discoveries through experience.
<br> 3. Discover your life’s purpose. We can’t control our emotions, but we can take
<br> charge of our actions every day. This is why we should have a clear sense of our
<br> purpose, and always keep Morita’s mantra in mind: “What do we need to be doing
<br> right now? What action should we be taking?” The key to achieving this is having
<br> dared to look inside yourself to find your ikigai.
<br> The four phases of Morita therapy
<br> Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the
<br> following stages:
<br> 1. Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During the first week of treatment,
<br> the patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books,
<br> family, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for
<br> most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid
<br> interacting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient
<br> to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the
<br> patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to
<br> the next stage of therapy.
<br> 2. Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient
<br> performs repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his
<br> thoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in,
<br> takes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple
<br> activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is
<br> still not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist.
<br> 3. Occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs
<br> tasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the
<br> mountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also
<br> immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The
<br> patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand.
<br> 4. The return to social life and the “real” world. The patient leaves the hospital
<br> and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and
<br> occupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as
<br> a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or
<br> emotional pressures.
<br> Naikan meditation
<br> Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his
<br> therapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on
<br> three questions the individual must ask him-or herself:
<br> 1. What have I received from person X?
<br> 2. What have I given to person X?
<br> 3. What problems have I caused person X?
<br> Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our
<br> problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As Morita said, “If you are
<br> angry and want to fight, think about it for three days before coming to blows.
<br> After three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.”
<br> 7
<br> And now, ikigai
<br> Logotherapy and Morita therapy are both grounded in a personal, unique
<br> experience that you can access without therapists or spiritual retreats: the mission
<br> of finding your ikigai, your existential fuel. Once you find it, it is only a matter of
<br> having the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path.
<br> In the following chapters, we’ll take a look at the basic tools you’ll need to get
<br> moving along that path: finding flow in the tasks you’ve chosen to do, eating in a
<br> balanced and mindful way, doing low-intensity exercise, and learning not to give
<br> in when difficulties arise. In order to do this, you have to accept that the world—
<br> like the people who live in it—is imperfect, but that it is still full of opportunities
<br> for growth and achievement.
<br> Are you ready to throw yourself into your passion as if it were the most
<br> important thing in the world?
<br> IV
<br> FIND FLOW IN EVERYTHING YOU DO
<br> How to turn work and free time
<br> into spaces for growth
<br> We are what we repeatedly do.
<br> Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.
<br> —Aristotle
<br> Going with the flow
<br> Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up
<br> on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect.
<br> You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how
<br> to move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present.
<br> You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a
<br> single entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or
<br> distracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you
<br> are doing.
<br> This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water,
<br> my friend.”
<br> We’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity
<br> we enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed.
<br> We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we
<br> notice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t
<br> realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our
<br> muscles ache.
<br> The opposite can also happen. When we have to complete a task we don’t want
<br> to do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we can’t stop looking at our watch.
<br> As the quip attributed to Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a
<br> minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems
<br> like a minute. That is relativity.”
<br> The funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we
<br> want to finish as quickly as possible.
<br> What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever
<br> worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions
<br> can help us discover our ikigai.
<br> The power of flow
<br> These questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s
<br> research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing.
<br> Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight,
<br> creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.
<br> There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your
<br> ikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through
<br> this state, to have an “optimal experience.”
<br> In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the
<br> time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing
<br> ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating
<br> too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front
<br> of the TV.
<br> As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal
<br> Experience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that
<br> nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will
<br> do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”
<br> It is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of
<br> concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also
<br> spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.
<br> According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way
<br> upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a
<br> surgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi
<br> analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same
<br> among individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all
<br> reach a state of flow in the same way.
<br> But what happens to our mind when we are in that state?
<br> When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions.
<br> Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while
<br> our mind is on other things.
<br> If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you
<br> consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your
<br> chances of achieving flow.
<br> The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow
<br> According to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the
<br> According to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the
<br> requirements for achieving flow are:
<br> 1. Knowing what to do
<br> 2. Knowing how to do it
<br> 3. Knowing how well you are doing
<br> 4. Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)
<br> 5. Perceiving significant challenges
<br> 6. Perceiving significant skills
<br> 7. Being free from distractions
<br> 1
<br> Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too
<br> difficult!)
<br> Schaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of
<br> completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.
<br> Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow
<br> them. If the rules for completing a task or achieving a purpose are too basic
<br> relative to our skill set, we will likely get bored. Activities that are too easy lead
<br> to apathy.
<br> If, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t
<br> have the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel
<br> frustrated, to boot.
<br> The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just
<br> a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest
<br> Hemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.”
<br> 2
<br> We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of
<br> pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be
<br> able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult
<br> achievement.”
<br> 3
<br> If you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next
<br> project. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a
<br> dancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed
<br> impossible for years.
<br> Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort
<br> zone.
<br> zone.
<br> Even doing something as simple as reading means following certain rules,
<br> having certain abilities and knowledge. If we set out to read a book on quantum
<br> mechanics for specialists in physics without being specialists in physics ourselves,
<br> we’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if
<br> we already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away.
<br> However, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds
<br> on what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will
<br> flow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our
<br> ikigai.
<br> Easy Challenging Beyond Our Abilities
<br> Boredom Flow Anxiety
<br> Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective
<br> Video games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to
<br> achieve flow, because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your
<br> own record while following a set of explicitly defined rules.
<br> Unfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations.
<br> According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their
<br> bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is
<br> that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the
<br> employees don’t know what their objectives are.
<br> What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost
<br> in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they
<br> don’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no
<br> destination.
<br> It is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective
<br> than to have a map. Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use
<br> the principle of “compass over maps” as a tool to navigate our world of
<br> uncertainty. In the book Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future, he and Jeff
<br> Howe write, “In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a
<br> detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A
<br> good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. It doesn’t
<br> mean that you should start your journey without any idea where you’re going.
<br> What it does mean is understanding that while the path to your goal may not be
<br> straight, you’ll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had
<br> trudged along a preplanned route.”
<br> In business, the creative professions, and education alike, it’s important to
<br> reflect on what we hope to achieve before starting to work, study, or make
<br> something. We should ask ourselves questions such as:
<br> What is my objective for today’s session in the studio?
<br> How many words am I going to write today for the article coming out next
<br> month?
<br> What is my team’s mission?
<br> How fast will I set the metronome tomorrow in order to play that sonata at
<br> an allegro tempo by the end of the week?
<br> Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to
<br> know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. Once the journey has
<br> begun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it.
<br> When Olympic athletes compete for a gold medal, they can’t stop to think how
<br> pretty the medal is. They have to be present in the moment—they have to flow. If
<br> they lose focus for a second, thinking how proud they’ll be to show the medal to
<br> their parents, they’ll almost certainly commit an error at a critical moment and
<br> will not win the competition.
<br> One common example of this is writer’s block. Imagine that a writer has to
<br> finish a novel in three months. The objective is clear; the problem is that the
<br> writer can’t stop obsessing over it. Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to
<br> write that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and
<br> cleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to
<br> work the next day.
<br> Days, weeks, and months pass, and the writer still hasn’t gotten anything down
<br> on the page, when all it would have taken was to sit down and get that first word
<br> out, then the second . . . to flow with the project, expressing her ikigai.
<br> As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you
<br> will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert
<br> Einstein, “a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”

<br> down to business

<br> Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task
<br> This is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much
<br> technology and so many distractions. We’re listening to a video on YouTube
<br> while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it.
<br> Then our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as soon as we respond to that
<br> message, we’re back at our computer, logging on to Facebook.
<br> Pretty soon thirty minutes have passed, and we’ve forgotten what the e-mail
<br> we were writing was supposed to be about.
<br> This also happens sometimes when we put on a movie with dinner and don’t
<br> realize how delicious the salmon was until we’re taking the last bite.
<br> We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence
<br> shows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at
<br> multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least
<br> productive people.
<br> Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually
<br> process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re
<br> really doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly.
<br> Unfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up
<br> spending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing
<br> one of them well.
<br> Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in
<br> achieving flow.
<br> According to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need:
<br> 1. To be in a distraction-free environment
<br> 2. To have control over what we are doing at every moment
<br> Technology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control
<br> of us. For example, if you have to write a research paper, you might sit down at
<br> your computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if
<br> you’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing
<br> that paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you
<br> that paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you
<br> out of your state of flow.
<br> It has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch
<br> back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and
<br> remember less of what we’ve done.
<br> Several studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass
<br> describe our generation as suffering from an epidemic of multitasking. One such
<br> study analyzed the behavior of hundreds of students, dividing them into groups
<br> based on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were
<br> the most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four
<br> tasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to a podcast,
<br> answering messages on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter
<br> timeline.
<br> Each group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue
<br> arrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows.
<br> At first, all the students answered correctly right away, without much trouble.
<br> As the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the
<br> same; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to
<br> multitasking had serious trouble counting the red arrows in the time allotted, or as
<br> quickly as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple
<br> reason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay
<br> attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the
<br> other students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the
<br> red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.
<br> 5
<br> Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our
<br> productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.
<br> One study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social
<br> Research found that a sample group of more than four thousand young adults
<br> between the ages of twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their
<br> smartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and
<br> were more likely to show signs of depression.

<br> Increases creativity Reduces creativity
<br> What can we do to avoid falling victim to this flow-impeding epidemic? How
<br> can we train our brains to focus on a single task? Here are a few ideas for
<br> creating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching
<br> a state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai:
<br> Don’t look at any kind of screen for the first hour you’re awake and the last
<br> hour before you go to sleep.
<br> Turn off your phone before you achieve flow. There is nothing more
<br> important than the task you have chosen to do during this time. If this seems
<br> too extreme, enable the “do not disturb” function so only the people closest
<br> to you can contact you in case of emergency.
<br> Designate one day of the week, perhaps a Saturday or Sunday, a day of
<br> technological “fasting,” making exceptions only for e-readers (without WiFi) or MP3 players.
<br> Go to a café that doesn’t have Wi-Fi.
<br> Read and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times
<br> clearly and stick to them.
<br> Try the Pomodoro Technique: Get yourself a kitchen timer (some are made
<br> to look like a pomodoro, or tomato) and commit to working on a single task
<br> as long as it’s running. The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of
<br> work and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of
<br> work and 10 minutes of rest. Find the pace that’s best for you; the most
<br> important thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle.
<br> Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward.
<br> Train your mind to return to the present when you find yourself getting
<br> distracted. Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a
<br> walk or a swim—whatever will help you get centered again.
<br> Work in a space where you will not be distracted. If you can’t do this at
<br> home, go to a library, a café, or, if your task involves playing the saxophone,
<br> a music studio. If you find that your surroundings continue to distract you,
<br> keep looking until you find the right place.
<br> Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its
<br> own place and time. For example, if you’re writing a magazine article, you
<br> could do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library
<br> in the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night.
<br> Bundle routine tasks—such as sending out invoices, making phone calls, and
<br> so on—and do them all at once.
<br> Advantages of Flow Disadvantages of Distraction
<br> A focused mind A wandering mind
<br> Living in the present Thinking about the past and the future
<br> We are free from worry
<br> Concerns about our daily life and the people around us
<br> invade our thoughts
<br> The hours fly by Every minute seems endless
<br> We feel in control We lose control and fail to complete the task at hand, or
<br> other tasks or people keep us from our work
<br> We prepare thoroughly We act without being prepared
<br> We know what we should be doing at any given moment We frequently get stuck and don’t know how to proceed
<br> Our mind is clear and overcomes all obstacles to the flow of
<br> thought
<br> We are plagued by doubts, concerns, and low self-esteem
<br> It’s pleasant It’s boring and exhausting
<br> Our ego fades: We are not the ones controlling the activity or
<br> task we’re doing—the task is leading us
<br> Constant self-criticism: Our ego is present and we feel
<br> frustrated
<br> Flow in Japan: Takumis, engineers, geniuses, and otakus
<br> What do takumis (artisans), engineers, inventors, and otakus (fans of anime and
<br> manga) have in common? They all understand the importance of flowing with
<br> their ikigai at all times.
<br> One widespread stereotype about people in Japan is that they’re exceptionally
<br> dedicated and hardworking, even though some Japanese people say they look like
<br> they’re working harder than they really are. There is no doubt, though, about their
<br> ability to be completely absorbed in a task, or about their perseverance when
<br> there is a problem to be solved. One of the first words one learns when starting
<br> Japanese lessons is ganbaru, which means “to persevere” or “to stay firm by doing
<br> one’s best.”
<br> Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an
<br> intensity that borders on obsession. We see this in all kinds of contexts, from the
<br> “retirees” taking meticulous care of their rice fields in the mountains of Nagano
<br> to the college students working the weekend shift in convenience stores known as
<br> konbinis. If you go to Japan, you’ll experience this attention to detail firsthand in
<br> almost every transaction.
<br> Walk into one of the stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa,
<br> or Kyoto and you’ll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional
<br> craftwork. The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new
<br> technologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques.
<br> The art of the takumi
<br> Toyota employs “artisans” who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand.
<br> These takumi, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to
<br> Toyota, and they are hard to replace. Some of them are the only people who
<br> know how to perform their exact skill, and it doesn’t seem as though a new
<br> generation is going to take up the mantle.
<br> Turntable needles are another example: They’re produced almost exclusively
<br> in Japan, where you can find the last remaining people who know how to use the
<br> machinery required to make these precision needles, and who are trying to pass
<br> on their knowledge to their descendants.
<br> We met a takumi on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. We were
<br> there for the day, working on a photo essay for one of the most famous brands of
<br> makeup brushes in the West. The billboard welcoming visitors to Kumano shows
<br> a mascot holding a large brush. In addition to the brush factories, the town is full
<br> of little houses and vegetable gardens; heading farther in, you can see several
<br> Shinto shrines at the base of the mountains that surround the town.
<br> We spent hours taking photos in factories full of people in orderly rows, each
<br> doing a single task—such as painting the handles of the brushes or loading boxes
<br> of them onto trucks—before we realized we still hadn’t seen anyone actually
<br> putting bristles into the brush heads.
<br> After we asked about this and got the runaround several times, the president
<br> of one company agreed to show us how it was done. He led us out of the building
<br> and asked us to get into his car. After a five-minute drive we parked next to
<br> another, smaller structure and climbed the stairs. He opened a door and we
<br> walked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.
<br> walked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.
<br> In the middle of the room was a woman wearing a mask. You could see only
<br> her eyes. She was so focused on choosing individual bristles for the brushes—
<br> gracefully moving her hands and fingers, using scissors and combs to sort the
<br> bristles—that she didn’t even notice our presence. Her movements were so quick
<br> it was hard to tell what she was doing.
<br> The president of the company interrupted her to let her know that we’d be
<br> taking photos as she worked. We couldn’t see her mouth, but the glint in her eye
<br> and the cheerful inflection in her speech let us know she was smiling. She looked
<br> happy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities.
<br> We had to use extremely fast shutter speeds to capture her movements. Her
<br> hands danced and flowed in concert with her tools and the bristles she was
<br> sorting.
<br> The president told us that this takumi was one of the most important people in
<br> the company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every
<br> bristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands.
<br> Steve Jobs in Japan
<br> Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. Not only did he visit the Sony
<br> factories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple,
<br> he was also captivated by the simplicity and quality of Japanese porcelain in
<br> Kyoto.
<br> It was not, however, an artisan from Kyoto who won Steve Jobs’s devotion, but
<br> rather a takumi from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique
<br> called Etchu Seto-yaki, known by only a few.
<br> On a visit to Kyoto, Jobs heard of an exhibition of Shakunaga’s work. He
<br> immediately understood that there was something special about Shakunaga’s
<br> porcelain. As a matter of fact, he bought several cups, vases, and plates, and went
<br> back to the show three times that week.
<br> Jobs returned to Kyoto several times over the course of his life in search of
<br> inspiration, and ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. It is said that Jobs had
<br> many questions for him—almost all of them about the fabrication process and the
<br> type of porcelain he used.
<br> Shakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from
<br> mountains in the Toyama prefecture, making him the only artist of his ilk
<br> familiar with the fabrication process of porcelain objects from their origins in the
<br> mountains to their final form—an authentic takumi.
<br> Jobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain
<br> where Shakunaga got his porcelain, but thought better of it when he heard that it
<br> was more than four hours by train from Kyoto.
<br> In an interview after Jobs’s death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his
<br> work had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He added that
<br> Jobs’s last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked
<br> for something special, “a new style.” To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150
<br> teacups in the process of testing out new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best
<br> and sent them to the Jobs family.
<br> Ever since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the
<br> country’s artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and
<br> cuisine (especially sushi).
<br> 7
<br> Sophisticated simplicity
<br> What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in
<br> common? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not a lazy simplicity but a
<br> sophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the
<br> body and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to one’s ikigai.
<br> As Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful
<br> challenge to overcome in order to maintain flow.
<br> The documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us another example of a takumi,
<br> this time in the kitchen. Its protagonist has been making sushi every day for more
<br> than eighty years, and owns a small sushi restaurant near the Ginza subway station
<br> in Tokyo. He and his son go every day to the famous Tsukiji fish market and
<br> choose the best fish to bring back to the restaurant.
<br> In the documentary, we see one of Jiro’s apprentices learning to make tamago
<br> (a thin, slightly sweet omelet). No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get Jiro’s
<br> approval. He keeps practicing for years until he finally does.
<br> Why does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs
<br> every day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too.
<br> Both Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook
<br> —they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they are
<br> in the kitchen; that is their happiness, their ikigai. They’ve learned to take
<br> pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time.
<br> Beyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep
<br> the challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that
<br> allows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from
<br> Michelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the
<br> business. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant.
<br> Jiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working
<br> conditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the
<br> best sushi in the world.
<br> Jiro, like Yukio Shakunaga, begins his work at “the source.” He goes to the
<br> fish market to find the best tuna; Shakunaga goes to the mountains to find the
<br> best porcelain. When they get down to work, both become one with the object
<br> they are creating. This unity with the object that they reach in a state of flow
<br> takes on special meaning in Japan, where, according to Shintoism, forests, trees,
<br> and objects have a kami (spirit or god) within them.
<br> When someone—whether an artist, an engineer, or a chef—sets out to create
<br> something, his or her responsibility is to use nature to give it “life” while
<br> respecting that nature at every moment. During this process, the artisan becomes
<br> one with the object and flows with it. An ironworker would say that metal has a
<br> life of its own, just as someone making ceramics would say that the clay does.
<br> The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man
<br> versus nature, but rather a union of the two.
<br> The purity of Ghibli
<br> There are those who say that the Shinto value of being connected with nature is
<br> vanishing. One of the harshest critics of this loss is another artist with a clearly
<br> defined ikigai: Hayao Miyazaki, the director of the animated films produced by
<br> Studio Ghibli.
<br> In nearly all his films we see humans, technology, fantasy, and nature in a state
<br> of conflict—and, in the end, coming together. One of the most poignant
<br> metaphors in his film Spirited Away is an obese spirit covered in trash that
<br> represents the pollution of the rivers.
<br> In Miyazaki’s films, forests have personalities, trees have feelings, and robots
<br> befriend birds. Considered a national treasure by the Japanese government,
<br> Miyazaki is an artist capable of becoming completely absorbed in his art. He uses
<br> a cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He
<br> “directs” his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by
<br> drawing, not by using a computer. Thanks to this obsession on the director’s part,
<br> Studio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire
<br> production process is carried out using traditional techniques.
<br> Those who have visited Studio Ghibli know that it is fairly typical, on a given
<br> Sunday to see a solitary individual tucked away in a corner, hard at work—a man
<br> in simple clothes who will greet them with an ohayo (hello) without looking up.
<br> Miyazaki is so passionate about his work that he spends many Sundays in the
<br> studio, enjoying the state of flow, putting his ikigai above all else. Visitors know
<br> that under no circumstances is one to bother Miyazaki, who is known for his
<br> quick temper—especially if he is interrupted while drawing.
<br> In 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. To commemorate his
<br> retirement, the television station NHK made a documentary showing him in his
<br> last days at work. He is drawing in nearly every scene of the film. In one scene,
<br> several of his colleagues are seen coming out of a meeting, and there he is,
<br> drawing in a corner, paying no attention to them. In another scene, he is shown
<br> walking to work on December 30 (a national holiday in Japan) and opening the
<br> doors of Studio Ghibli so he can spend the day there, drawing alone.
<br> Miyazaki can’t stop drawing. The day after his “retirement,” instead of going
<br> on vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw.
<br> His colleagues put on their best poker faces, not knowing what to say. One year
<br> later, he announced he wouldn’t make any more feature films but that he would
<br> keep on drawing until the day he died.
<br> Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does?
<br> The recluses
<br> It is not only the Japanese who have this capacity; there are artists and scientists
<br> all over the world with strong, clear ikigais. They do what they love until their
<br> dying day.
<br> The last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula
<br> that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he
<br> died, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he
<br> would have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics or
<br> mathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while
<br> working on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless
<br> pleasure.
<br> Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are
<br> really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the
<br> expense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles
<br> of flow to their lives to an extreme.
<br> Another example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He
<br> sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every
<br> few years.
<br> Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their
<br> environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.
<br> Microflow: Enjoying mundane tasks
<br> But what happens when we have to, say, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or attend
<br> to paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable?
<br> Near the Shinjuku subway station, in one of the neural centers of Tokyo, there
<br> is a supermarket that still employs elevator operators. The elevators are fairly
<br> standard and could easily be operated by the customers, but the store prefers to
<br> provide the service of someone holding the door open for you, pushing the button
<br> for your floor, and bowing as you exit.
<br> If you ask around, you’ll learn that there is one elevator operator who has been
<br> doing the same job since 2004. She is always smiling and enthusiastic about her
<br> work. How is she able to enjoy such a job? Doesn’t she get bored doing
<br> something so repetitive?
<br> On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the elevator operator is not just
<br> pushing buttons but is instead performing a whole sequence of movements. She
<br> begins by greeting the customers with a songlike salutation followed by a bow and
<br> a welcoming wave of the hand. Then she presses the elevator button with a
<br> graceful movement, as though she is a geisha offering a client a cup of tea.
<br> Csikszentmihalyi calls this microflow.
<br> We’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep
<br> ourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being
<br> challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our
<br> ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy,
<br> is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.
<br> is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.
<br> Even Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. He says he enjoys it—that it
<br> helps him relax and clear his mind, and that he tries to do it a little better each
<br> day, following an established order or set of rules he’s made for himself: plates
<br> first, forks second, and so on.
<br> It’s one of his daily moments of microflow.
<br> Richard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all time, also took
<br> pleasure in routine tasks. W. Daniel Hillis, one of the founders of the
<br> supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, hired Feynman to work on the
<br> development of a computer that could handle parallel processing when he was
<br> already world famous. He says Feynman showed up on his first day of work and
<br> said, “OK, boss, what’s my assignment?” They didn’t have anything prepared, so
<br> they asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately
<br> realized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, “That
<br> sounds like a bunch of baloney—give me something real to do.”
<br> So they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his
<br> assignment with a smile on his face. When he didn’t have something important to
<br> do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing—say,
<br> painting the office walls.
<br> Weeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors
<br> declared, “You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering
<br> circuits.”
<br> 8
<br> Instant vacations: Getting there through meditation
<br> Training the mind can get us to a place of flow more quickly. Meditation is one
<br> way to exercise our mental muscles.
<br> There are many types of meditation, but they all have the same objective:
<br> calming the mind, observing our thoughts and emotions, and centering our focus
<br> on a single object.
<br> The basic practice involves sitting with a straight back and focusing on your
<br> breath. Anyone can do it, and you feel a difference after just one session. By
<br> fixing your attention on the air moving in and out of your nose, you can slow the
<br> torrent of thoughts and clear your mental horizons.
<br> The Archer’s Secret
<br> The winner of the 1988 Olympic gold medal for archery was a seventeenyear-old woman from South Korea. When asked how she prepared, she
<br> replied that the most important part of her training was meditating for two
<br> hours each day.
<br> If we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent
<br> antidote to our smartphones and their notifications constantly clamoring for our
<br> attention.
<br> One of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is
<br> worrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching
<br> “nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey.
<br> Since the mind is a constant swirl of thoughts, ideas, and emotions, slowing
<br> down the “centrifuge”—even for just a few seconds—can help us feel more
<br> rested and leave us with a sense of clarity.
<br> In fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry
<br> about anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss
<br> might flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a
<br> cloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty
<br> thousand we have every day, according to some experts.
<br> Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in
<br> meditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a
<br> beginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are
<br> activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a
<br> hot bath.
<br> We all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how
<br> to get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice.
<br> Humans as ritualistic beings
<br> Life is inherently ritualistic. We could argue that humans naturally follow rituals
<br> that keep us busy. In some modern cultures, we have been forced out of our
<br> ritualistic lives to pursue goal after goal in order to be seen as successful. But
<br> throughout history, humans have always been busy. We were hunting, cooking,
<br> farming, exploring, and raising families—activities that were structured as rituals
<br> to keep us busy throughout our days.
<br> But in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices in
<br> But in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices in
<br> modern Japan. The main religions in Japan—Confucianism, Buddhism, and
<br> Shintoism—are all ones in which the rituals are more important than absolute
<br> rules.
<br> When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on
<br> something is more important than the final results. Whether this is good or bad
<br> for the economy is beyond the scope of this book. What is indisputable, though,
<br> is that finding flow in a “ritualistic workplace” is much easier than in one in
<br> which we are continually stressed out trying to achieve unclear goals set by our
<br> bosses.
<br> Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow.
<br> When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed
<br> by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to
<br> achieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts
<br> and then attack each part one by one.
<br> Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of
<br> flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the
<br> doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.”
<br> The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones
<br> who spend more time than others in a state of flow.
<br> Using flow to find your ikigai
<br> After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in
<br> your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask
<br> yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in
<br> common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the
<br> activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people?
<br> Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just
<br> to think?
<br> In the answers to these questions you might find the underlying ikigai that
<br> drives your life. If you don’t, then keep searching by going deeper into what you
<br> like by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. Also, try
<br> new things that are not on the list of what makes you flow but that are similar and
<br> that you are curious about. For example, if photography is something that drives
<br> you into flow, you could also try painting; you might even like it more! Or if you
<br> love snowboarding and have never tried surfing . . .
<br> Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will
<br> flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai.
<br> V
<br> MASTERS OF LONGEVITY
<br> Words of wisdom from the
<br> longest-living people in the world
<br> WHEN WE STARTED working on this book, we didn’t want to just research the factors that contribute to a long and
<br> happy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art.
<br> The interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the
<br> section that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of
<br> a few international champions of longevity. We’re talking about
<br> supercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more.
<br> The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness
<br> Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it
<br> appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe’s Generations. Today there are an
<br> estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only
<br> around 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren’t superheroes, but we could see
<br> them as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life
<br> expectancy would predict.
<br> Given the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of
<br> supercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help
<br> us join their ranks.
<br> Let’s take a look at what a few of them have to say.
<br> Misao Okawa (117)
<br> “Eat and sleep, and you’ll live a long time. You have to learn to
<br> relax.”
<br> According to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living
<br> person in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in
<br> Osaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days.
<br> The daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its
<br> colonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and
<br> launched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three
<br> different centuries—cared for herself unassisted.
<br> When specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply,
<br> “Eating sushi and sleeping,” to which we should add, having a tremendous thirst
<br> for life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a
<br> smile, “I ask myself the same thing.”
<br> 1
<br> Proof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year
<br> Sakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the
<br> oldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women.
<br> María Capovilla (116)
<br> “I’ve never eaten meat in my life.”
<br> Born in Ecuador in 1889, María Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the
<br> world’s oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days
<br> old, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great-and
<br> great-great-grandchildren.
<br> She gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her
<br> thoughts:
<br> I’m happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I’d live so long, I thought I’d
<br> die long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had
<br> two daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
<br> Things were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were
<br> more restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: “María” by Luis Alarcón. I still remember
<br> most of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day.
<br> I like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when
<br> I was in school.

<br> When she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her
<br> great passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger.
<br> When asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, “I don’t
<br> know what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I’ve never eaten meat in
<br> my life. I attribute it to that.”
<br> Jeanne Calment (122)
<br> “Everything’s fine.”
<br> Born in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4,
<br> 1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She
<br> jokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that
<br> jokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that
<br> she broke numerous records as she went on celebrating birthdays.
<br> She died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied
<br> herself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her
<br> own until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally
<br> starting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her
<br> cataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips.
<br> One of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her
<br> 120th birthday, “I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”

<br> Walter Breuning (114)
<br> “If you keep your mind and body busy, you’ll be around a long
<br> time.”
<br> Born in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his
<br> lifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he’d had two wives
<br> and a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted
<br> living center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the secondoldest man (of verified age) ever born in the United States.
<br> He gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity
<br> stemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day
<br> and working for as many years as he could. “Your mind and your body. You keep
<br> both busy,” he said on his 112th birthday, “you’ll be here a long time.” Back then,
<br> he was still exercising every day.
<br> Among Breuning’s other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he
<br> wasn’t afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated
<br> Press, “We’re all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid
<br> to die. Because you’re born to die.”
<br> 4
<br> Before passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he’d made a
<br> deal with God: If he wasn’t going to get better, it was time to go.
<br> Alexander Imich (111)
<br> “I just haven’t died yet.”
<br> Born in Poland in 1903, Alexander Imich was a chemist and parapsychologist
<br> residing in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014,
<br> residing in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014,
<br> became the oldest man of authenticated age in the world. Imich himself died
<br> shortly thereafter, in June of that year, leaving behind a long life rich with
<br> experiences.
<br> Imich attributed his longevity to, among other things, never drinking alcohol.
<br> “It’s not as though I’d won the Nobel Prize,” he said upon being declared the
<br> world’s oldest man. “I never thought I’d get to be so old.” When asked about his
<br> secret to living so long, his answer was “I don’t know. I just haven’t died yet.”

<br> Ikigai artists
<br> The secret to long life, however, is not held by supercentenarians alone. There are
<br> many people of advanced age who, though they haven’t made it into Guinness
<br> World Records, offer us inspiration and ideas for bringing energy and meaning to
<br> our lives.
<br> Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring,
<br> have this power.
<br> Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and purpose to our
<br> days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all human beings have
<br> access to.
<br> Hokusai, the Japanese artist who made woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style
<br> and lived for 88 years, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century,
<br> added this postscript to the first edition of his One Hundred Views of Mount
<br> Fuji:
<br> 6
<br> All that I have produced before the age of 70 is not worth being counted. It is at the age of 73 that I
<br> have somewhat begun to understand the structure of true nature, of animals and grasses, and trees and
<br> birds, and fishes and insects; consequently at 80 years of age I shall have made still more progress; at
<br> 90 I hope to have penetrated into the mystery of things; at 100 years of age I should have reached
<br> decidedly a marvelous degree, and when I shall be 110, all that I do, every point and every line, shall be
<br> instinct with life.
<br> In the pages that follow, we’ve collected some of the most inspirational words
<br> from artists interviewed by Camille Sweeney for the New York Times.
<br> 7 Of those
<br> still living, none have retired, and all still enjoy their passion, which they plan to
<br> pursue until their final breath, demonstrating that when you have a clear purpose,
<br> no one can stop you.
<br> The actor Christopher Plummer, still working at eighty-six, reveals a dark
<br> desire shared by many who love the profession: “We want to drop dead onstage.
<br> That would be a nice theatrical way to go.”
<br> 8
<br> Osamu Tezuka, the father of modern Japanese manga, shared this feeling.
<br> Before he died in 1989, his last words as he drew one final cartoon were “Please,
<br> just let me work!”
<br> 9
<br> The eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared on a stroll
<br> through Paris that he likes to work, which is why he does it with such intensity.
<br> “Everybody complains about their aches and pains and all that, but my friends are
<br> either dead or are still working,” he said.
<br> 10
<br> Carmen Herrera, a painter who just entered her one hundredth year, sold her
<br> first canvas at age eighty-nine. Today her work is in the permanent collections of
<br> the Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art. When asked how she viewed
<br> her future, she responded, “I am always waiting to finish the next thing. Absurd, I
<br> know. I go day by day.”
<br> 11
<br> Never Stop Learning
<br> “You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake
<br> at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only
<br> love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know
<br> your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one
<br> thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it.
<br> That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate,
<br> never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of
<br> regretting.”
<br> —T. H. White, The Once and Future King
<br> For his part, naturalist and author Edward O. Wilson asserted, “I feel I have
<br> enough experience to join those who are addressing big questions. About ten
<br> years ago, when I began reading and thinking more broadly about the questions of
<br> what are we, where did we come from and where are we going, I was astonished
<br> at how little this was being done.”
<br> 12
<br> Ellsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two,
<br> assured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth,
<br> because instead we develop a greater clarity and capacity for observation. “It’s
<br> one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see
<br> new things. That’s why there are new paintings.”
<br> 13
<br> At eighty-six, the architect Frank Gehry reminds us that some buildings can
<br> take seven years “from the time you’re hired until you’re finished,”
<br> 14 a fact that
<br> favors a patient attitude with regard to the passage of time. The man responsible
<br> for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, however, knows how to live in the here and
<br> now: “You stay in your time. You don’t go backward. I think if you relate to the
<br> time you’re in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see what’s going
<br> on, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time.”
<br> 15
<br> Longevity in Japan
<br> Because of its robust civil registry, many of those verified as having lived
<br> the longest are found in the United States; however, there are many
<br> centenarians living in remote villages in other countries. A peaceful life in
<br> the countryside seems pretty common among people who have watched a
<br> century pass.
<br> Without question, the international superstar of longevity is Japan,
<br> which has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. In
<br> addition to a healthy diet, which we will explore in detail, and an
<br> integrated health care system in which people go to the doctor for regular
<br> checkups to prevent disease, longevity in Japan is closely tied to its
<br> culture, as we will see later on.
<br> The sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an
<br> effort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to
<br> long life.
<br> If you want to stay busy even when there’s no need to work, there has
<br> to be an ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your
<br> life and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the
<br> community and yourself.
<br> VI
<br> LESSONS FROM JAPAN’S CENTENARIANS
<br> Traditions and proverbs for
<br> happiness and longevity
<br> TO GET TO Ogimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months
<br> earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the
<br> purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous
<br> conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the
<br> town.
<br> One year after starting this project, we found ourselves on the doorstep of
<br> some of the longest-living people in the world.
<br> We realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the
<br> entire town were living in an endless here and now.
<br> Arriving in Ogimi
<br> After two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about
<br> the traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the
<br> mountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests.
<br> Once Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is
<br> made, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little
<br> houses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the
<br> base of the mountain.
<br> We pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there as we enter the
<br> municipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our
<br> GPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and
<br> Promotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right
<br> off the highway.
<br> We go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us.
<br> Beside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two
<br> other women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room.
<br> They serve us each a cup of green tea and a few shikuwasa, a small citrus fruit
<br> that packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on.
<br> Taira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner
<br> and a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the
<br> town’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or moai. Taira points out that these
<br> groups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The moai are
<br> not organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family.
<br> Taira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what
<br> happens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes
<br> care of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of
<br> the community.
<br> Ogimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of
<br> the largest island in the archipelago.
<br> From the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to look down over the
<br> whole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us
<br> wonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a
<br> few houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys
<br> accessible by side roads.
<br> Communal life
<br> We’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the
<br> only three tables are already reserved.
<br> “Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki,
<br> walking back to her car.
<br> She’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot
<br> is ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive
<br> fast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt.
<br> Finally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat.
<br> “I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost
<br> everything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from
<br> Tanaka, who’s been my friend forever.”
<br> The restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet
<br> Tatooine, from Star Wars. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow
<br> food” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town.
<br> “But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is
<br> extroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of
<br> several associations run by the local government.
<br> “Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the
<br> diminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a
<br> good time.”
<br> There are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live
<br> there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is
<br> there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is
<br> divided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several
<br> people in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity.
<br> Residents pay close attention to this last category.
<br> We’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods.
<br> It is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle,
<br> home to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites.
<br> The Bunagaya Spirits of the Yanbaru Jungle
<br> Bunagaya are magical creatures that inhabit the Yanbaru jungle near
<br> Ogimi and its surrounding towns. They manifest as children with long red
<br> hair, and like to hide in the jungle’s gajumaru (banyan) trees and go
<br> fishing on the beach.
<br> Many of Okinawa’s stories and fables are about bunagaya sprites. They
<br> are mischievous, playful, and unpredictable. Locals say that the bunagaya
<br> love the mountains, rivers, sea, trees, earth, wind, and animals, and that if
<br> you want to befriend them, you have to show respect for nature.
<br> A birthday party
<br> When we arrive at the neighborhood’s community center, we’re greeted by a
<br> group of about twenty people who proudly proclaim, “The youngest among us is
<br> eighty-three!”
<br> We conduct our interviews at a large table while drinking green tea. When we
<br> finish, we’re brought to an event space, where we celebrate the birthdays of three
<br> members of the group. One woman is turning ninety-nine, another ninety-four,
<br> and one “young man” has just reached eighty-nine.
<br> We sing a few songs popular in the village and finish up with “Happy
<br> Birthday” in English. The woman turning ninety-nine blows out the candles and
<br> thanks everyone for coming to her party. We eat homemade shikuwasa cake and
<br> end up dancing and celebrating as though it were the birthday of a
<br> twentysomething.
<br> It’s the first party, but not the last, that we’ll attend during our week in the
<br> village. We’ll also do karaoke with a group of seniors who sing better than we do,
<br> and attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the
<br> and attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the
<br> foot of a mountain.
<br> Celebrate each day, together
<br> Celebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi.
<br> We’re invited to watch a game of gateball, one of the most popular sports
<br> among Okinawa’s older residents. It involves hitting a ball with a mallet-like stick.
<br> It is a low-impact sport that can be played anywhere, and is a good excuse to
<br> move around and have fun as a group. The residents hold local competitions, and
<br> there is no age limit for participants.
<br> We participate in the weekly game and lose to a woman who recently turned
<br> 104. Everyone cheers, and the defeated look on our faces elicits laughter.
<br> In addition to playing and celebrating as a community, spirituality is also
<br> essential to the happiness of the village’s residents.
<br> The gods of Okinawa
<br> The main religion in Okinawa is known as Ryukyu Shinto. Ryukyu is the original
<br> name of the Okinawa archipelago, and Shinto means “the path of the gods.”
<br> 1
<br> Ryukyu Shinto combines elements of Chinese Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism,
<br> and Shintoism with shamanistic and animistic elements.
<br> According to this ancient faith, the world is populated by an infinite number
<br> of spirits divided into several types: spirits of the home, of the forest, of the trees,
<br> and of the mountains. It is important to appease these spirits through rituals and
<br> festivals, and by consecrating sacred grounds.
<br> Okinawa is full of sacred jungles and forests, where many of the two main
<br> kinds of temples are found: the utaki and the uganju. We visited an uganju, or
<br> small, open-air temple adorned with incense and coins, next to a waterfall in
<br> Ogimi. The utaki is a collection of stones where people go to pray and where,
<br> supposedly, spirits gather.
<br> In Okinawa’s religious practice, women are considered spiritually superior to
<br> men, whereas the opposite is true of traditional Shintoism in the rest of Japan.
<br> Yuta are women chosen as mediums by their communities to make contact with
<br> the spirit realm through traditional rites.
<br> Ancestor worship is another important feature of spiritual practice in
<br> Okinawa, and in Japan in general. The home of each generation’s firstborn
<br> usually contains a butsudan, or small altar, used to pray for and make offerings to
<br> the family’s ancestors.
<br> Mabui
<br> Every person has an essence, or mabui. This mabui is our spirit and the
<br> source of our life force. It is immortal and makes us who we are.
<br> Sometimes, the mabui of someone who has died is trapped in the body
<br> of a living person. This situation requires a separation ritual to free the
<br> mabui of the deceased; it often happens when a person dies suddenly—
<br> especially at a young age—and his or her mabui does not want to move on
<br> to the realm of the dead.
<br> A mabui can also be passed from person to person by physical contact.
<br> A grandmother who leaves her granddaughter a ring transfers a part of her
<br> mabui to her. Photographs can also be a medium for passing mabui among
<br> people.
<br> The older, the stronger
<br> Looking back, our days in Ogimi were intense but relaxed—sort of like the
<br> lifestyle of the locals, who always seemed to be busy with important tasks but
<br> who, upon closer inspection, did everything with a sense of calm. They were
<br> always pursuing their ikigai, but they were never in a rush.
<br> Not only did they seem to be happily busy, but we also noticed that they
<br> followed the other principles for happiness that Washington Burnap stated two
<br> hundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to
<br> do, something to love, and something to hope for.”
<br> 2
<br> On our last day, we went to buy gifts at a small market at the edge of town.
<br> The only things sold there are local vegetables, green tea, and shikuwasa juice,
<br> along with bottles of water from a spring hidden in the Yanbaru forests, bearing
<br> labels that read “Longevity Water.”
<br> We bought ourselves some of this Longevity Water and drank it in the parking
<br> lot, looking out over the sea and hoping that the little bottles that promised a
<br> magic elixir would bring us health and long life, and would help us find our own
<br> ikigai. Then we took a photo with a statue of a bunagaya, and walked up to it one
<br> last time to read the inscription:
<br> A Declaration from the Town Where People Live Longest
<br> At 80 I am still a child.
<br> When I come to see you at 90,
<br> send me away to wait until I’m 100.
<br> The older, the stronger;
<br> let us not depend too much on our children as we age.
<br> If you seek long life and health, you are welcome in our village,
<br> where you will be blessed by nature,
<br> and together we will discover the secret to longevity.
<br> April 23, 1993
<br> Ogimi Federation of Senior Citizen Clubs
<br> The interviews
<br> Over the course of a week we conducted a total of one hundred interviews, asking
<br> the eldest members of the community about their life philosophy, their ikigai, and
<br> the secrets to longevity. We filmed these conversations with two cameras for use
<br> in a little documentary, and chose a few especially meaningful and inspiring
<br> statements to include in this section of the book.
<br> 1. Don’t worry
<br> “The secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young—don’t let it grow old. Open
<br> your heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your
<br> grandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.”
<br> “The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go
<br> out there and say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the
<br> afternoon, I spend time with friends.”
<br> “Here, everyone gets along. We try not to cause problems. Spending time together and having fun is
<br> the only thing that matters.”
<br> 2. Cultivate good habits
<br> 2. Cultivate good habits
<br> “I feel joy every morning waking up at six and opening the curtains to look out at my garden, where I
<br> grow my own vegetables. I go right outside to check on my tomatoes, my mandarin oranges . . . I love
<br> the sight of them—it relaxes me. After an hour in the garden I go back inside and make breakfast.”
<br> “I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself. That’s my ikigai.”
<br> “The key to staying sharp in old age is in your fingers. From your fingers to your brain, and back again.
<br> If you keep your fingers busy, you’ll live to see one hundred.”
<br> “I get up at four every day. I set my alarm for that time, have a cup of coffee, and do a little exercise,
<br> lifting my arms. That gives me energy for the rest of the day.”
<br> “I eat a bit of everything; I think that’s the secret. I like variety in what I eat; I think it tastes better.”
<br> “Working. If you don’t work, your body breaks down.”
<br> “When I wake up, I go to the butsudan and light incense. You have to keep your ancestors in mind. It’s
<br> the first thing I do every morning.”
<br> “I wake up every day at the same time, early, and spend the morning in my vegetable garden. I go
<br> dancing with my friends once a week.”
<br> “I do exercise every day, and every morning I go for a little walk.”
<br> “I never forget to do my taiso exercises when I get up.”
<br> “Eating vegetables—it helps you live longer.”
<br> “To live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well, and spend time with
<br> people.”
<br> 3. Nurture your friendships every day
<br> “Getting together with my friends is my most important ikigai. We all get together here and talk—it’s
<br> very important. I always know I’ll see them all here tomorrow, and that’s one of my favorite things in
<br> life.”
<br> “My main hobby is getting together with friends and neighbors.”
<br> “Talking each day with the people you love, that’s the secret to a long life.”
<br> “I say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ to the children on their way to school, and wave at everyone who
<br> goes by me in their car. ‘Drive safely!’ I say. Between 7:20 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., I’m outside on my feet
<br> the whole time, saying hello to people. Once everyone’s gone, I go back inside.”
<br> “Chatting and drinking tea with my neighbors. That’s the best thing in life. And singing together.”
<br> “I wake up at five every morning, leave the house, and walk to the sea. Then I go to a friend’s house
<br> and we have tea together. That’s the secret to long life: getting together with people, and going from
<br> place to place.”
<br> 4. Live an unhurried life
<br> “My secret to a long life is always saying to myself, ‘Slow down,’ and ‘Relax.’ You live much longer if
<br> you’re not in a hurry.”
<br> “I make things with wicker. That’s my ikigai. The first thing I do when I wake up is pray. Then I do my
<br> exercises and eat breakfast. At seven I calmly start working on my wicker. When I get tired at five, I
<br> go visit my friends.”
<br> “Doing many different things every day. Always staying busy, but doing one thing at a time, without
<br> getting overwhelmed.”
<br> “The secret to long life is going to bed early, waking up early, and going for a walk. Living peacefully
<br> and enjoying the little things. Getting along with your friends. Spring, summer, fall, winter . . .
<br> enjoying each season, happily.”
<br> 5. Be optimistic
<br> “Every day I say to myself, ‘Today will be full of health and energy. Live it to the fullest.’”
<br> “I’m ninety-eight, but consider myself young. I still have so much to do.”
<br> “Laugh. Laughter is the most important thing. I laugh wherever I go.”
<br> “I’m going to live to be a hundred. Of course I am! It’s a huge motivation for me.”
<br> “Dancing and singing with your grandchildren is the best thing in life.”
<br> “I feel very fortunate to have been born here. I give thanks for it every day.”
<br> “The most important thing in Ogimi, in life, is to keep smiling.”
<br> “I do volunteer work to give back to the village a bit of what it has given to me. For example, I use my
<br> car to help friends get to the hospital.”
<br> “There’s no secret to it. The trick is just to live.”
<br> Keys to the Ogimi Lifestyle
<br> One hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable
<br> garden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa,
<br> and so on.
<br> All belong to some form of neighborhood association, where they feel
<br> cared for as though by family.
<br> They celebrate all the time, even little things. Music, song, and dance
<br> are essential parts of daily life.
<br> They have an important purpose in life, or several. They have an ikigai,
<br> but they don’t take it too seriously. They are relaxed and enjoy all that
<br> they do.
<br> They are very proud of their traditions and local culture.
<br> They are passionate about everything they do, however insignificant it
<br> might seem.
<br> Locals have a strong sense of yuimaaru—recognizing the connection
<br> between people. They help each other with everything from work in the
<br> fields (harvesting sugarcane or planting rice) to building houses and
<br> municipal projects. Our friend Miyagi, who ate dinner with us on our
<br> last night in town, told us that he was building a new home with the help
<br> of all his friends, and that we could stay there the next time we were in
<br> Ogimi.
<br> They are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow
<br> them to relax. We didn’t see a single old grandpa sitting on a bench
<br> doing nothing. They’re always coming and going—to sing karaoke, visit
<br> with neighbors, or play a game of gateball.

<br> THE IKIGAI DIET
<br> What the world’s longest-living
<br> people eat and drink
<br> ACCORDING TO THEWorld Health Organization, Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world: 85 years for
<br> men and 87.3 years for women. Moreover, it has the highest ratio of centenarians in the world: more than
<br> 520 for every million people (as of September 2016).
<br> Source: World Health Organization, 1966; Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2004; U.S.
<br> Department of Health and Human Services/CDC, 2005
<br> The above graphic, which compares life expectancy in Japan, its province
<br> Okinawa, Sweden, and the United States, shows that, while life expectancy in
<br> Japan is high overall, Okinawa exceeds the national average.
<br> Okinawa is one of the areas in Japan that were most affected by World War II.
<br> As a result not only of conflicts on the battlefield but also of hunger and a lack of
<br> resources once the war ended, the average life expectancy was not very high
<br> during the 1940s and 1950s. As Okinawans recovered from the destruction,
<br> however, they came to be some of the country’s longest-living citizens.
<br> What secrets to long life do the Japanese hold? What is it about Okinawa that
<br> What secrets to long life do the Japanese hold? What is it about Okinawa that
<br> makes it the best of the best in terms of life expectancy?
<br> Experts point out that, for one thing, Okinawa is the only province in Japan
<br> without trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the
<br> only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s
<br> recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.
<br> Okinawa’s miracle diet
<br> The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Okinawa is the lowest in Japan,
<br> and diet almost certainly has a lot to do with this. It is no coincidence that the
<br> “Okinawa Diet” is so often discussed around the world at panels on nutrition.
<br> The most concrete and widely cited data on diet in Okinawa come from
<br> studies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who
<br> has published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging
<br> in Okinawa since 1970.
<br> Bradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research
<br> team and published a book considered the bible on the subject, The Okinawa
<br> Program.
<br> 1 They reached the following conclusions:
<br> Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be
<br> key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different
<br> foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen
<br> different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our
<br> fast-food culture.
<br> They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least
<br> seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily
<br> basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to
<br> make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers,
<br> carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color
<br> and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are
<br> the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily
<br> calories comes from vegetables.
<br> Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every
<br> day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as
<br> well.
<br> They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through
<br> several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank
<br> a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a
<br> sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.
<br> In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of
<br> three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently
<br> consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.
<br> Along these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following:
<br> Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of
<br> Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a
<br> part of their diet.
<br> They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per
<br> day, compared to an average of 12.
<br> They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to
<br> 2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the
<br> five Blue Zones.
<br> Hara hachi bu
<br> This brings us back to the 80 percent rule we mentioned in the first chapter, a
<br> concept known in Japanese as hara hachi bu. It’s easy to do: When you notice
<br> you’re almost full but could have a little more . . . just stop eating!
<br> One easy way to start applying the concept of hara hachi bu is to skip dessert.
<br> Or to reduce portion size. The idea is to still be a little bit hungry when you finish.
<br> This is why portion size tends to be much smaller in Japan than in the West.
<br> Food isn’t served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it’s much more
<br> common to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice,
<br> another with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving
<br> food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and
<br> facilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter.
<br> Hara hachi bu is an ancient practice. The twelfth-century book on Zen
<br> Buddhism Zazen Youjinki recommends eating two-thirds as much as you might
<br> want to. Eating less than one might want is common among all Buddhist temples
<br> in the East. Perhaps Buddhism recognized the benefits of limiting caloric intake
<br> more than nine centuries ago.
<br> So, eat less to live longer?
<br> Few would challenge this idea. Without taking it to the extreme of malnutrition,
<br> of course, eating fewer calories than our bodies ask for seems to increase
<br> longevity. The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating
<br> foods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those
<br> that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value.
<br> The calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways
<br> to add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many,
<br> calories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on
<br> digestion alone.
<br> Another benefit of calorie restriction is that it reduces levels of IGF-1
<br> (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the body. IGF-1 is a protein that plays a
<br> significant role in the aging process; it seems that one of the reasons humans and
<br> animals age is an excess of this protein in their blood.
<br> 2
<br> Whether calorie restriction will extend lifespan in humans is not yet known,
<br> but data increasingly indicate that moderate calorie restriction with adequate
<br> nutrition has a powerful protective effect against obesity, type 2 diabetes,
<br> inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and reduces metabolic
<br> risk factors associated with cancer.
<br> 3
<br> An alternative to following the 80 percent rule on a daily basis is to fast for
<br> one or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of
<br> fasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating
<br> normally on the other five days.
<br> Among its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows
<br> it to rest.
<br> 15 natural antioxidants found in the Okinawan diet
<br> Antioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing
<br> the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging. The antioxidant power
<br> of green tea, for example, is well known, and will be discussed later at greater
<br> length.
<br> length.
<br> Because they are rich in antioxidants and are eaten nearly every day in the
<br> region, these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality:
<br> Tofu
<br> Miso
<br> Tuna
<br> Carrots
<br> Goya (bitter melon)
<br> Kombu (sea kelp)
<br> Cabbage
<br> Nori (seaweed)
<br> Onion
<br> Soy sprouts
<br> Hechima (cucumber-like gourd)
<br> Soybeans (boiled or raw)
<br> Sweet potato
<br> Peppers
<br> Sanpin-cha (jasmine tea)
<br> Sanpin-cha: The reigning infusion in Okinawa
<br> Okinawans drink more Sanpin-cha—a mix of green tea and jasmine flowers—
<br> than any other kind of tea. The closest approximation in the West would be the
<br> jasmine tea that usually comes from China. A 1988 study conducted by Hiroko
<br> Sho at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology indicates that jasmine
<br> tea reduces blood cholesterol levels.
<br> 4
<br> Sanpin-cha can be found in many different forms in Okinawa, and is even
<br> available in vending machines. In addition to all the antioxidant benefits of green
<br> tea, it boasts the benefits of jasmine, which include:
<br> Reducing the risk of heart attack
<br> Strengthening the immune system
<br> Helping relieve stress
<br> Lowering cholesterol
<br> Okinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.
<br> Okinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.
<br> It might be hard to find exactly the same blend in the West, but we can drink
<br> jasmine tea, or even a high-quality green tea, instead.
<br> The secrets of green tea
<br> Green tea has been credited for centuries with significant medicinal properties.
<br> Recent studies have confirmed its many benefits, and have attested to the
<br> importance of this ancient plant in the longevity of those who drink it often.
<br> Originally from China, where it has been consumed for millennia, green tea
<br> didn’t make its way to the rest of the world until just a few centuries ago. Unlike
<br> other teas, and as a result of being air-dried without fermentation, it retains its
<br> active elements even after being dried and crumbled. It offers meaningful health
<br> benefits such as:
<br> Controlling cholesterol
<br> Lowering blood sugar levels
<br> Improving circulation
<br> Protection against the flu (vitamin C)
<br> Promoting bone health (fluoride)
<br> Protection against certain bacterial infections
<br> Protection against UV damage
<br> Cleansing and diuretic effects
<br> White tea, with its high concentration of polyphenols, may be even more
<br> effective against aging. In fact, it is considered to be the natural product with the
<br> greatest antioxidant power in the world—to the extent that one cup of white tea
<br> might pack the same punch as about a dozen glasses of orange juice.
<br> In summary: Drinking green or white tea every day can help us reduce the free
<br> radicals in our bodies, keeping us young longer.
<br> The powerful shikuwasa
<br> Shikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest
<br> producer in all of Japan.
<br> The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without
<br> diluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a
<br> mandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance.
<br> Shikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in
<br> antioxidants.
<br> All citrus fruits—grapefruits, oranges, lemons—are high in nobiletin, but
<br> Okinawa’s shikuwasas have forty times as much as oranges. Consuming nobiletin
<br> has been proven to protect us from arteriosclerosis, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and
<br> obesity in general.
<br> Shikuwasas also contain vitamins C and B1, beta carotene, and minerals. They
<br> are used in many traditional dishes and to add flavor to food, and are squeezed to
<br> make juice. While conducting research at the birthday parties of the town’s
<br> “grandparents,” we were served shikuwasa cake.
<br> The Antioxidant Canon, for Westerners
<br> In 2010 the UK’s Daily Mirror published a list of foods recommended by
<br> experts to combat aging. Among these foods readily available in the West
<br> are:
<br> Vegetables such as broccoli and chard, for their high concentration of
<br> water, minerals, and fiber
<br> Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines, for all the
<br> antioxidants in their fat
<br> Fruits such as citrus, strawberries, and apricots; they are an excellent
<br> source of vitamins and help eliminate toxins from the body
<br> Berries such as blueberries and goji berries; they are rich in
<br> phytochemical antioxidants
<br> Dried fruits, which contain vitamins and antioxidants, and give you
<br> energy
<br> Grains such as oats and wheat, which give you energy and contain
<br> minerals
<br> Olive oil, for its antioxidant effects that show in your skin
<br> Red wine, in moderation, for its antioxidant and vasodilatory properties
<br> Foods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed
<br> baked goods, and prepared foods, along with cow’s milk and all its
<br> derivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the
<br> derivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the
<br> process of premature aging.

<br> GENTLE MOVEMENTS, LONGER LIFE
<br> Exercises from the East that
<br> promote health and longevity
<br> STUDIES FROM THEBlue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise
<br> but rather the ones who move the most.
<br> When we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even
<br> people over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don’t stay at
<br> home looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi’s residents walk a
<br> lot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as
<br> they’ve had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They
<br> don’t go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in
<br> the course of their daily routines.
<br> As Easy as Getting out of Your Chair
<br> “Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The
<br> enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where
<br> it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol
<br> drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things
<br> going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,” says Gavin
<br> Bradley
<br> 1
<br> in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.
<br> 2
<br> Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director
<br> of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how
<br> detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.
<br> If we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways
<br> every day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good
<br> for the body.
<br> The Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have
<br> become quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been
<br> used for ages to promote health.
<br> Yoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China’s
<br> qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a
<br> person’s body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and
<br> serenity.
<br> They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.
<br> They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.
<br> These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly
<br> appropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit.
<br> Tai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of
<br> osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease, to increase circulation, and to improve
<br> muscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a
<br> great shield against stress and depression.
<br> You don’t need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As
<br> Japanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day.
<br> Practicing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do
<br> so. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in
<br> chapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don’t like any of
<br> these disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you
<br> move.
<br> In the following pages we’ll take a look at some of the practices that promote
<br> health and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise
<br> for starting your day.
<br> Radio taiso
<br> This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio”
<br> part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted
<br> over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a
<br> television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.
<br> One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity
<br> among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools
<br> before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.
<br> Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few
<br> minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we
<br> interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we
<br> visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the
<br> exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we
<br> felt refreshed for the rest of the day.
<br> When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a
<br> large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.
<br> The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or
<br> only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint
<br> mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising
<br> mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising
<br> your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It
<br> is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity
<br> and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.
<br> It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without
<br> raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using
<br> computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times
<br> we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard
<br> or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the
<br> time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the
<br> basic movements of the body.
<br> Basic version of the radio taiso exercises (5 minutes).
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Yoga
<br> Popular in Japan as well as in the West, yoga can be done by almost anyone.
<br> Some of its poses have even been adapted for pregnant women and practitioners
<br> with physical disabilities.
<br> Yoga comes from India, where it was developed millennia ago to unite our
<br> mental and physical elements. The word yoga itself comes from the Sanskrit term
<br> for “yoke,” which refers to the crosspiece that binds draft animals to one another
<br> and to the cart they’re pulling. Yoga strives to unite body and mind in the same
<br> way, guiding us toward a healthy lifestyle in harmony with the world around us.
<br> The main objectives of yoga are:
<br> To bring us closer to our (human) nature
<br> Mental and physical purification
<br> To bring us closer to the divine
<br> Styles of yoga
<br> Though all are oriented toward similar goals, there are many different types of
<br> yoga that vary according to the traditions and texts from which they were
<br> developed. The differences among them lie, as the masters say, in the path taken
<br> to the summit of our best self.
<br> Jnana yoga: the yoga of wisdom; the search for discipline and mental
<br> growth
<br> Karma yoga: focuses on action, on tasks and duties that benefit oneself and
<br> one’s community
<br> Bhakti yoga: the yoga of devotion and surrender to the divine
<br> Mantra yoga: focuses on the recitation of mantras to reach a state of
<br> relaxation
<br> Kundalini yoga: combines diverse steps to reach the desired mental state
<br> Raja yoga: also known as the royal path; encompasses a range of steps
<br> geared toward achieving communion with oneself and others
<br> Hatha yoga: the most widespread form in the West and Japan; characterized
<br> by asanas or poses combined in a quest for balance
<br> How to do a Sun Salutation
<br> The Sun Salutation is one of the most iconic exercises in hatha yoga. To do it, you
<br> simply have to follow these twelve basic movements:
<br> 1. With your feet together, stand up straight but keep your muscles relaxed.
<br> Exhale.
<br> 2. Place the palms of your hands together in front of your chest; from this
<br> position, inhale as you raise your arms above your head and bend backward
<br> slightly.
<br> 3. Exhale as you bend forward until you touch the ground with the palms of
<br> your hands, without bending your knees.
<br> 4. Stretch one leg back to touch the floor with the tips of your toes. Inhale.
<br> 5. Bring the other leg back, keeping your legs and arms straight, as you hold
<br> your breath.
<br> 6. As you exhale, bend your arms and bring your chest to the ground and then
<br> forward, resting your knees on the ground.
<br> 7. Straighten your arms and bend your spine back, keeping the lower half of
<br> your body on the ground. Inhale.
<br> 8. With your hands and feet on the ground, lift your hips until your arms and
<br> legs are straight and your body forms an upside-down V. Exhale throughout
<br> the movement.
<br> 9. Bring forward the same leg you’d stretched back earlier and bend it so that
<br> your knee and foot are aligned under your head and between your hands.
<br> Inhale.
<br> 10. Exhale as you bring your back foot forward and straighten your legs, keeping
<br> your hands on the ground as in posture 3.
<br> 11. Bring your arms above your head with your palms together and bend
<br> backward slightly, as you did in posture 2, while you inhale.
<br> 12. Lower your arms to their initial position in mountain pose while you exhale.
<br> You’ve just greeted the sun; now you’re ready to have a fantastic day.
<br> Tai chi
<br> Also known as t’ai chi ch’uan (or taijiquan), tai chi is a Chinese martial art that
<br> can be traced back hundreds of years to Buddhism and Confucianism; it is very
<br> popular in Japan, too.
<br> According to Chinese tradition, it was created by the Taoist master and martial
<br> arts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng, though it was Yang Luchan who in the
<br> nineteenth century brought the form to the rest of the world.
<br> Tai chi was originally a neijia, or internal martial art, meaning its goal was
<br> personal growth. Focused on self-defense, it teaches those who practice it to
<br> defeat their adversaries by using the least amount of force possible and by relying
<br> on agility.
<br> Tai chi, which was also seen as a means of healing body and mind, would go
<br> on to be used more frequently to foster health and inner peace. To encourage its
<br> citizens to be more active, the Chinese government promoted it as an exercise,
<br> and it lost its original connection to martial arts, becoming instead a source of
<br> health and well-being accessible to all.
<br> Styles of tai chi
<br> There are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best
<br> known:
<br> Chen-style: alternates between slow movements and explosive ones
<br> Yang-style: the most widespread of the forms; characterized by slow, fluid
<br> movements
<br> Wu-style: utilizes small, slow, deliberate movements
<br> Hao-style: centered on internal movements, with almost microscopic
<br> external movements; one of the least practiced forms of tai chi, even in
<br> China
<br> Despite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives:
<br> 1. To control movement through stillness
<br> 2. To overcome force through finesse
<br> 3. To move second and arrive first
<br> 4. To know yourself and your opponent
<br> The ten basic principles of tai chi
<br> According to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten
<br> basic principles:
<br> 1. Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there.
<br> 2. Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body.
<br> 3. Relax your waist and let it guide your body.
<br> 4. Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your
<br> weight is distributed.
<br> 5. Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the
<br> flow of energy.
<br> 6. Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body.
<br> 7. Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert.
<br> 8. Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath.
<br> 9. Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony.
<br> 10. Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind.
<br> Imitating clouds
<br> One of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of
<br> clouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds. Here are the steps:
<br> 1. Extend your arms in front of you with your palms down.
<br> 2. Turn your palms to face in, as though you were hugging a tree trunk.
<br> 3. Open your arms out to the side.
<br> 4. Bring the left arm up and center, and the right arm down and center.
<br> 5. Trace the shape of a ball in front of your body.
<br> 6. Turn your left palm toward your face.
<br> 7. Shift your weight to your left foot and pivot from your hip toward that side,
<br> while your eyes follow the movement of your hand.
<br> 8. Bring your left hand to your waist and your right hand in front of your face.
<br> 9. Shift your weight to your right foot.
<br> 10. Pivot toward your right, looking at your raised right hand the entire time.
<br> 11. Repeat this movement fluidly, shifting your weight from one foot to the
<br> other as you reposition your hands.
<br> 12. Stretch your arms out in front of you again and bring them down slowly,
<br> returning to your initial position.
<br> Qigong
<br> Also known as chi kung, its name combines qi (life force, or energy) and gong
<br> (work), indicating that the form works with the individual’s life force. Though
<br> relatively modern, especially under its current name, the art of qigong is based on
<br> the Tao yin, an ancient art meant to foster mental and physical well-being.
<br> The practice began to appear in reports on training and martial arts at the
<br> beginning of the twentieth century, and by the 1930s was being used in hospitals.
<br> The Chinese government later popularized it, as it had done with tai chi.
<br> Qigong involves static and dynamic physical exercises that stimulate
<br> respiration in a standing, seated, or reclined position. There are many different
<br> styles of qigong, but all of them seek to strengthen and regenerate qi. Though its
<br> movements are typically gentle, the practice is intense.
<br> Benefits of qigong
<br> According to numerous international scientific studies, qigong—like tai chi and
<br> yoga—offers significant health benefits. The following stand out among those
<br> proven through scientific research, as observed by Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier of San
<br> Francisco’s Qigong Institute in his article “Medical Applications of Qigong”
<br> 3
<br> :
<br> Modification of brain waves
<br> Improved balance of sex hormones
<br> Lower mortality rate from heart attacks
<br> Lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension
<br> Greater bone density
<br> Better circulation
<br> Deceleration of symptoms associated with senility
<br> Greater balance and efficiency of bodily functions
<br> Increased blood flow to the brain and greater mind-body connection
<br> Improved cardiac function
<br> Reduction in the secondary effects of cancer treatments
<br> Practicing these arts not only keeps us in shape, it also helps extend our lives.
<br> Methods for practicing qigong
<br> In order to practice qigong correctly, we should remember that our life energy
<br> flows through our whole body. We should know how to regulate its many parts:
<br> 1. Tyau Shenn: (regulating the body) by adopting the correct posture—it is

<br> emptying the mind of thoughts

<br> elements, so that it flows naturally

<br> In this way, the whole organism will be prepared to work together toward a
<br> single goal.
<br> The five elements of qigong
<br> One of qigong’s best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements:
<br> One of qigong’s best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements:
<br> earth, water, wood, metal, and fire. This series of movements seeks to balance the
<br> five currents of energy in order to improve brain and organ function.
<br> There are several ways to do these movements. In this case, we’re following
<br> the model of Professor María Isabel García Monreal from the Qigong Institute in
<br> Barcelona.
<br> EARTH
<br> 1. Stand with your legs apart and your feet directly below your shoulders.
<br> 2. Turn your feet outward slightly to strengthen the posture.
<br> 3. Keep your shoulders relaxed and down and your arms loose at your sides,
<br> slightly away from your body (this is the Wu Qi, or rooted, posture).
<br> 4. As you inhale, raise your arms in front of you until your hands are level with
<br> your shoulders, your palms facing down.
<br> 5. Exhale as you bend your knees and bring your arms down until your hands
<br> are level with your stomach, your palms facing in.
<br> 6. Hold this position for a few seconds, focusing on your breath.
<br> WATER
<br> 1. Starting from Earth posture, bend your knees into a squat, keeping your chest
<br> upright and exhaling throughout.
<br> 2. Press your coccyx downward to stretch your lumbar spine.
<br> 3. As you inhale, stand to return to Earth posture.
<br> 4. 4. Repeat twice, for a total of three.
<br> WOOD
<br> 1. Starting from Earth posture, turn your palms upward and open your arms to
<br> the side, forming a circle as you inhale, until your hands are level with your
<br> clavicle. Turn your hands so that your palms and elbows point downward,
<br> while keeping your shoulders relaxed.
<br> 2. Reverse the movement as you exhale, making a downward circle with your
<br> arms until you reach your initial position.
<br> 3. Repeat twice, for a total of three.
<br> METAL
<br> 1. Starting from Earth posture, raise your arms until your hands are level with
<br> your sternum.
<br> 2. Turn your palms toward each other, about four inches apart, with your
<br> fingers relaxed and slightly separated, pointing upward.
<br> 3. As you inhale, move your hands away from each other until they are shoulder
<br> width apart.
<br> 4. As you exhale, bring your hands toward each other until they are back in
<br> position 2.
<br> 5. Repeat twice, for a total of three, observing the concentration of energy as
<br> you bring your hands together in front of your lungs.
<br> FIRE
<br> 1. Starting from Earth posture, bring your hands level with your heart as you
<br> inhale, with one hand slightly above the other and your palms facing each
<br> other.
<br> 2. Rotate your hands to feel the energy of your heart.
<br> 3. Turn from your waist gently to the left, keeping your torso relaxed and your
<br> forearms parallel to the ground.
<br> 4. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up
<br> until it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your
<br> abdomen.
<br> 5. Turn from your waist gently to the right, keeping your torso relaxed and your
<br> forearms parallel to the ground.
<br> 6. As you exhale, let your hands come back together in front of your heart.
<br> 7. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up
<br> until it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your
<br> abdomen.
<br> COMPLETING THE SERIES
<br> 1. Starting from Earth posture, inhale as you bring your hands level with your
<br> shoulders, palms facing down.
<br> 2. As you exhale, lower your arms to rest at your sides, returning to the initial
<br> Wu Qi posture.
<br> Shiatsu
<br> Created in Japan in the early twentieth century, principally for the treatment of
<br> arthritis, shiatsu also works on energy flow through the application of pressure
<br> with the thumbs and the palms of the hands. In combination with stretching and
<br> breathing exercises, it seeks to create equilibrium among the different elements
<br> of the body.
<br> It is not important that a Tao Yin* have a name, is imitating something, or is
<br> engraved in jade. What is important is the technique and the essence of
<br> what is really practiced. Stretching and contracting, bending and lifting of
<br> the head, stepping, lying down, resting or standing, walking or stepping
<br> slowly, screaming or breathing—everything can be a Tao Yin.
<br> —Ge Hong
<br> 5
<br> Breathe better, live longer
<br> The book Xiuzhen shishu, known in the West as Ten Books on the Cultivation of
<br> Perfection, dates back to the thirteenth century and is a compendium of materials
<br> from diverse sources on developing the mind and body.
<br> It quotes, among others, the celebrated Chinese doctor and essayist Sun
<br> Simiao, who lived during the sixth century. Sun Simiao was a proponent of a
<br> technique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of
<br> movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our
<br> souls to a place of calm.
<br> The six sounds are:
<br> Xu, pronounced like “shh” with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver
<br> He, pronounced like “her” with a yawn, which is associated with the heart
<br> Si, pronounced like “sir” with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs
<br> Chui, pronounced like “chwee” with a forceful exhale, which is associated
<br> with the kidneys
<br> Hoo, pronounced like “who,” which is associated with the spleen
<br> Xi, pronounced like “she, ” which connects the whole body
<br> The following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well
<br> according to the season. It reminds us of the importance of breathing, and
<br> suggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the
<br> healing sounds.
<br> In spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver.
<br> In summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace.
<br> In fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist.
<br> For the kidneys, next, breathe chui and see your inner waters calm.
<br> The Triple Heater needs your xi to expel all heat and troubles.
<br> In all four seasons, take deep breaths so your spleen can process food.
<br> And, of course, avoid exhaling noisily; don’t let even your own ears hear you.
<br> The practice is most excellent and will help preserve your divine elixir.
<br> It might feel confusing to be presented with all the Eastern traditions we have
<br> introduced in this chapter. The takeaway is that they all combine a physical
<br> exercise with an awareness of our breath. These two components—movement
<br> and breath—help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of
<br> allowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. Most of the
<br> time, we are just not aware enough of our breathing.
<br> IX
<br> RESILIENCE AND WABI-SABI
<br> How to face life’s challenges
<br> without letting stress and worry age
<br> you
<br> What is resilience?
<br> One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they
<br> pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards
<br> seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another.
<br> We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among
<br> psychologists.
<br> But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it
<br> is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life
<br> rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by
<br> negative emotions.
<br> In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond
<br> resilience to cultivate antifragility.
<br> Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this
<br> can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind,
<br> body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs.
<br> Nana korobi ya oki 七転び八起き
<br> Fall seven times, rise eight.
<br> —Japanese proverb
<br> Resilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the
<br> easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our
<br> lives.
<br> Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what
<br> matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of
<br> their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune.
<br> They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they
<br> can’t.
<br> In the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr:
<br> God, give us grace to accept with serenity
<br> the things that cannot be changed,
<br> Courage to change the things
<br> which should be changed,
<br> and the Wisdom to distinguish
<br> the one from the other.
<br> the one from the other.
<br> Emotional resilience through Buddhism and Stoicism
<br> Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew
<br> up in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child.
<br> Not satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a
<br> different lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t
<br> asceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he
<br> sought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a
<br> wise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these
<br> pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by
<br> them.
<br> Zeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic
<br> lives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only
<br> thing they owned was the clothing on their backs.
<br> Seeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned
<br> its teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there
<br> is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control
<br> of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to
<br> disappear.
<br> The goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in
<br> Cynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions.
<br> Since their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism
<br> has been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are
<br> very different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions.
<br> Both Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing wellbeing.
<br> According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can
<br> enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who
<br> were able to control their emotions as virtuous.
<br> What’s the worst thing that could happen?
<br> We finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a
<br> better one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can’t live
<br> without a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been
<br> without a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been
<br> pining for and suddenly find we have a wandering eye.
<br> People can be insatiable.
<br> The Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth
<br> pursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility
<br> (apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity,
<br> and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity,
<br> and gratitude.
<br> In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like
<br> negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order
<br> to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them.
<br> To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but
<br> without worrying about them.
<br> Seneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was,
<br> nonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization
<br> every night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative
<br> situations, he actually put them into practice—for example, by living for a week
<br> without servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a
<br> result, he was able to answer the question “What’s the worst thing that could
<br> happen?”
<br> Meditating for healthier emotions
<br> In addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions,
<br> another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we
<br> can’t, as we see in the Serenity Prayer.
<br> Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We
<br> should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn
<br> will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.
<br> In the words of Epictetus, “It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that
<br> matters.”
<br> 1
<br> In Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of our desires and
<br> emotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of
<br> keeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts
<br> and emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way,
<br> we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment.
<br> One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling
<br> negative emotions: “Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ,” in which oṃ is the generosity that
<br> purifies the ego, ma is the ethics that purifies jealousy, ṇi is the patience that
<br> purifies passion and desire, pad is the precision that purifies bias, me is the
<br> surrender that purifies greed, and hūṃ is the wisdom that purifies hatred.
<br> The here and now, and the impermanence of things
<br> Another key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both
<br> Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the
<br> only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we
<br> should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.
<br> “The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the present moment,”
<br> observes the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.
<br> In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on
<br> the impermanence of the things around us.
<br> The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the
<br> leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said
<br> that changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the
<br> essence of the universe—a rather Buddhist notion, in fact.
<br> We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will
<br> disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without
<br> giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have
<br> to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who
<br> surround us.
<br> “All things human are short-lived and perishable,” Seneca tells us.
<br> 2
<br> The temporary, ephemeral, and impermanent nature of the world is central to
<br> every Buddhist discipline. Keeping this always in mind helps us avoid excessive
<br> pain in times of loss.
<br> Wabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e
<br> Wabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting,
<br> changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for
<br> beauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.
<br> This is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or
<br> This is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or
<br> cracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can
<br> truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.
<br> A complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be
<br> translated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard
<br> most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter—whether with
<br> friends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that
<br> we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or
<br> the future.
<br> The concept is commonly used in tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and
<br> Japanese martial arts, all of which place emphasis on being present in the
<br> moment.
<br> In the West, we’ve grown accustomed to the permanence of the stone
<br> buildings and cathedrals of Europe, which sometimes gives us the sense that
<br> nothing changes, making us forget about the passage of time. Greco-Roman
<br> architecture adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and
<br> statues of the gods that outlast the centuries.
<br> Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn’t try to be imposing or perfect,
<br> because it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. The tradition of making structures out
<br> of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to
<br> rebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and
<br> everything we create.
<br> The Grand Shrine of Ise,
<br> 3
<br> for example, has been rebuilt every twenty years for
<br> centuries. The most important thing is not to keep the building standing for
<br> generations, but to preserve customs and traditions—things that can withstand the
<br> passage of time better than structures made by human hands.
<br> The key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no
<br> control, like the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of the world around us.
<br> Ichi-go ichi-e teaches us to focus on the present and enjoy each moment that
<br> life brings us. This is why it is so important to find and pursue our ikigai.
<br> Wabi-sabi teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an
<br> opportunity for growth.
<br> Beyond resilience: Antifragility
<br> As the legend goes, the first time Hercules faced the Hydra, he despaired when
<br> he discovered that cutting off one of its heads meant that two would grow back in
<br> its place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every
<br> its place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every
<br> wound.
<br> As Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains in Antifragile: Things That Gain from
<br> Disorder,
<br> 4 we use the word fragile to describe people, things, and organizations
<br> that are weakened when harmed, and the words robust and resilient for things that
<br> are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for
<br> things that get stronger when harmed (up to a point).
<br> To refer to the kind of power possessed by the Hydra of Lerna, to talk about
<br> things that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term
<br> antifragile: “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists
<br> shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”
<br> Catastrophes and exceptional circumstances offer good models for explaining
<br> antifragility. In 2011 a tsunami hit the Tōhoku region of Japan, doing tremendous
<br> damage to dozens of cities and towns along the coast, most famously Fukushima.
<br> When we visited the affected coast two years after the catastrophe, having
<br> driven for hours along cracked highways and past one empty gas station after
<br> another, we passed through several ghost towns whose streets had been taken over
<br> by the remnants of houses, piles of cars, and empty train stations. These towns
<br> were fragile spaces that had been forgotten by the government and could not
<br> recover on their own.
<br> Other places, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, suffered extensive damage
<br> but were rebuilt within a few years, thanks to the efforts of many. Ishinomaki and
<br> Kesennuma showed how resilient they were in their ability to return to normal
<br> after the catastrophe.
<br> The earthquake that caused the tsunami also affected the Fukushima nuclear
<br> power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working at the plant
<br> were not prepared to recover from that kind of damage. The Fukushima nuclear
<br> facility is still in a state of emergency and will be for decades to come. It
<br> demonstrated its fragility in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe.
<br> The Japanese financial markets closed minutes after the earthquake. Which
<br> businesses did the best in the aftermath? Stock in big construction companies has
<br> been steadily on the rise since 2011; the need to rebuild the entire coast of
<br> Tōhoku is a boon for construction. In this case, Japanese construction companies
<br> are antifragile, since they benefited enormously from the catastrophe.
<br> Now let’s take a look at how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How
<br> can we be more antifragile?
<br> Step 1: Create redundancies
<br> Step 1: Create redundancies
<br> Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your
<br> hobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one
<br> salary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble,
<br> leaving you in a position of fragility. On the other hand, if you have several
<br> options and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up
<br> dedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money
<br> at it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case,
<br> antifragile.
<br> One hundred percent of the seniors we interviewed in Ogimi had a primary
<br> and a secondary occupation. Most of them kept a vegetable garden as a secondary
<br> job, and sold their produce at the local market.
<br> The same idea goes for friendships and personal interests. It’s just a matter, as
<br> the saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket.
<br> In the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their
<br> energy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose
<br> everything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated
<br> strong friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to
<br> move on at the end of a relationship. They’ll be antifragile.
<br> Right now you might be thinking, “I don’t need more than one salary, and I’m
<br> happy with the friends I’ve always had. Why should I add anything new?” It might
<br> seem like a waste of time to add variation to our lives, because extraordinary
<br> things don’t ordinarily happen. We slip into a comfort zone. But the unexpected
<br> always happens, sooner or later.
<br> Step 2: Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small
<br> risks in others
<br> The world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you
<br> have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixedterm deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth
<br> potential—say, $100 in each.
<br> One possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the
<br> value of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the
<br> value of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the startups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more).
<br> You still make money, even if three of the businesses go completely belly-up.
<br> You’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.
<br> You’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.
<br> The key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to
<br> great reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, such as
<br> investing $10,000 in a fund of questionable reputation that we saw advertised in
<br> the newspaper.
<br> Step 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile
<br> We’re taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me
<br> fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us
<br> vulnerable. Who and what are they?
<br> When we make our New Year’s resolutions, we tend to emphasize adding new
<br> challenges to our lives. It’s great to have this kind of objective, but setting “good
<br> riddance” goals can have an even bigger impact. For example:
<br> Stop snacking between meals
<br> Eat sweets only once a week
<br> Gradually pay off all debt
<br> Avoid spending time with toxic people
<br> Avoid spending time doing things we don’t enjoy, simply because we feel
<br> obligated to do them
<br> Spend no more than twenty minutes on Facebook per day
<br> To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each
<br> setback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find
<br> a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused
<br> on our ikigai.
<br> Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that
<br> we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set
<br> new and better goals. As Taleb writes in Antifragile, “We need randomness, mess,
<br> adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things
<br> that make life worth living.” We encourage those interested in the concept of
<br> antifragility to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile.
<br> Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the
<br> passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense
<br> of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem
<br> almost like an eternity.
<br> EPILOGUE
<br> Ikigai: The art of living
<br> Mitsuo Aida was one of the most important calligraphers and haikuists of the
<br> twentieth century. He is yet another example of a Japanese person who dedicated
<br> his life to a very specific ikigai: communicating emotions with seventeen-syllable
<br> poems, using a shodo calligraphy brush.
<br> Many of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present
<br> moment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be
<br> translated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”
<br> いまここにしかないわたし
<br> のいのちあなたのいのち
<br> In another poem, Aida writes simply, “Here, now.” It is an artwork that seeks
<br> to evoke feelings of mono no aware (a melancholy appreciation of the
<br> ephemeral).
<br> いまここ
<br> The following poem touches on one of the secrets of bringing ikigai into our
<br> lives: “Happiness is always determined by your heart.”
<br> しあわせはいつも自分の心がきめる
<br> This last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”
<br> This last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”
<br> そのままでいいがな
<br> Once you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring
<br> meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a
<br> happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef
<br> who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love.
<br> Conclusion
<br> Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we
<br> are all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what
<br> is meaningful to us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel
<br> despair.
<br> Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very
<br> easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives
<br> (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take
<br> over your life.
<br> Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us
<br> connect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or
<br> change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things
<br> that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we
<br> might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.
<br> There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned
<br> from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it.
<br> Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that
<br> keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who
<br> love you.
<br> The ten rules of ikigai
<br> We’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the
<br> long-living residents of Ogimi:
<br> 1. Stay active; don’t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and
<br> do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing
<br> things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping
<br> out, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional
<br> activity has ended.
<br> 2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As
<br> the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency
<br> behind, life and time take on new meaning.
<br> 3. Don’t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life,
<br> too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should
<br> eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.
<br> 4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine,
<br> there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your
<br> day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.
<br> 5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it
<br> flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit
<br> of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases
<br> hormones that make us feel happy.
<br> 6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends.
<br> It’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget
<br> what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.
<br> 7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days,
<br> human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it
<br> often to recharge our batteries.
<br> 8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air
<br> you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that
<br> brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every
<br> day giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.
<br> 9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today
<br> is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.
<br> 10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that
<br> gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the
<br> very end. If you don’t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your
<br> mission is to discover it.
<br> The authors of this book wish you a long, happy, and purposeful life.

<br> NOTES
<br> Chapter I. Ikigai
<br> 1 Dan Buettner. The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who’ve Lived the Longest.
<br> People in all Blue Zones (except Adventists) drink alcohol moderately and regularly. Moderate drinkers
<br> outlive nondrinkers. The trick is to drink 1–2 glasses per day (preferably Sardinian Cannonau wine),
<br> with friends and/or with food. And no, you can’t save up all week and have 14 drinks on Saturday.
